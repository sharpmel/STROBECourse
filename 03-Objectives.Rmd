**Examples of Good Reporting**

**Specific examples from QA:** 
- ME-3 A priori hypothesis: if one or more biomarkers are used as proxy measures, state the a priori hypothesis on the expected values of the biomarker(s)
- STROME-ID 3.1: state the epidemiological objectives of using molecular typing
- STREGA 3 State if the study is the first report of a genetic association, a replication effort, or both.
- VET 3 (b) Ensure that the level of organization is clear for each objective and hypothesis
- ROSES-I 3.1: State the specific measure of occurrence that is being estimated, for example, point seroprevalence, cumulative incidence of infection, secondary infection risk
