# Methods: Variables (7)
> The items from STROBE state that you should report:   
-	Clearly define all outcomes, exposures, predictors, potential confounders, and effect modifiers. Give diagnostic criteria, if applicable.

-	EULAR Clearly deﬁne start and stop of therapy    
-	ROSES-I 7.1 The median age and range for each exposure group should be reported   
-	SBR7 Describe the theoretical and/or conceptual rationale for the design of the intervention/ exposure  
-	SBR7 Describe the intervention/exposure with sufficient detail to permit replication  
-	SBR7 Clearly describe all simulation-specific exposures, potential confounders, and effect modifiers  
-	AMS7.6 Include description of potential confounders (other than epidemiological variables)  
-	RDS 7 (a) If applicable, clearly define all outcomes, correlates, predictors, potential confounders, effect modifiers, and diagnostic criteria  
-	VET7 (c) For hypothesis-driven studies, the putative causal structure among variables should be described (a diagram is strongly encouraged)  
-	7 (a) For each variable of interest, give sources of data and details of methods of assessment (measurement). If applicable, describe comparability of assessment methods among groups and over time  
-	For each variable of interest, give sources of data and details of methods of assessment
(measurement). Describe comparability of assessment methods if there is more than one group  
-	VET7 (b) Describe the level of organization at which each variable was measured  
-	ROSES- I 7.2: Describe the potential for immunization (specify vaccine and timing of vaccination in relationship to collection of serum), if applicable, to affect the outcome measures   

**Explanation [@vandenbroucke2007]**</br>
Authors should define all variables considered for and
included in the analysis, including outcomes, exposures,
predictors, potential confounders and potential effect modifiers.
Disease outcomes require adequately detailed description
of the diagnostic criteria. This applies to criteria for cases
in a case-control study, disease events during follow-up in a
cohort study and prevalent disease in a cross-sectional study.
Clear definitions and steps taken to adhere to them are
particularly important for any disease condition of primary
interest in the study.
For some studies, ‘determinant’ or ‘predictor’ may be
appropriate terms for exposure variables and outcomes may
be called ‘endpoints’. In multivariable models, authors sometimes
use ‘dependent variable’ for an outcome and ‘independent
variable’ or ‘explanatory variable’ for exposure and
confounding variables. The latter is not precise as it does not
distinguish exposures from confounders.
If many variables have been measured and included in
exploratory analyses in an early discovery phase, consider
providing a list with details on each variable in an appendix,
additional table or separate publication. Of note, the International
Journal of Epidemiology recently launched a new
section with ‘cohort profiles’, that includes detailed information
on what was measured at different points in time in
particular studies.56,57 Finally, we advise that authors declare
all ‘candidate variables’ considered for statistical analysis,
rather than selectively reporting only those included in the
final models (see also item 16a).58,59

<h2> Field-specific guidance:</h2>  
-	RECORD 7.1: A complete list of codes and algorithms used to classify exposures, outcomes, confounders, and effect modiﬁers should be provided. If these cannot be reported, an explanation should be provided.  
-	STREGA 7 (b) Clearly define genetic exposures (genetic variants) using a widely-used nomenclature system. Identify variables likely to be associated with population stratification (confounding by ethnic origin)  
-	nut-7.1. Clearly deﬁne foods, food groups, nutrients, or other food components.  
-	nut-7.2. When using dietary patterns or indices, describe the methods to obtain them and their nutritional properties.
-	ROSES-I 7.4: Describe illness definitions and methods for ascertaining the presence or absence of clinical illness in subjects
-	ROSES-I 7.2: Describe the potential for immunization (specify vaccine and timing of vaccination in relationship to collection of serum), if applicable, to affect the outcome measures
-	ROSES-I 7.3: Describe any known or potential immunological cross-reactivity that may bias the outcome measures
-	STROBE-NI 7.1: state criteria used to deﬁne clinically signiﬁcant organisms for each sample type
-	AMS7.1 Specify antimicrobial usage according to: type, dosage, duration and route of administration
-	AMS7.2 Provide information using defined daily dosages (DDDs) and, in addition, other definitions closer to local reality (packages, prescriptions). Provide justification for the measurement presented
-	AMS7.3 Address antimicrobial combinations
-	AMS7.4 Explain rationale for grouping of antimicrobials
-	AMS7.5 Define time at risk for antimicrobial exposure and for resistance development
-	AMS7.7 Provide definition of resistance, multidrug resistance, including pattern of co-resistance; whether studies performed to identify location or resistance eg, plasmid, chromosome, integron, transposon
-	AMS7.8 Definition of infection and/or colonisation. If not a validated reference, provide evidence of robustness of the new definition
-	MARES7–1 Exposure: Detail the medications used, including dose(s) and route(s) of administration. If more than one medication is used, state the planned time interval between medications, preferably in hours
-	MARES7–2 Outcome: Define successful medical abortion (should most commonly be considered as successful expulsion of the intrauterine pregnancy without need for surgical intervention).
-	MARES7–3 Outcome: Define the types of medical abortion failure (e.g., ongoing pregnancy, incomplete abortion, participant symptoms). Continuing pregnancy should be defined as a viable pregnancy following treatment (to be differentiated from a non-viable [i.e., retained gestational sac]).
-	RDS7 (b) State how recruiter–recruit relationship was tracked  
-	ROSES- I 7.3: Describe any known or potential immunological cross- reactivity that may bias the outcome measures
