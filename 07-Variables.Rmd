# Methods: Variables (7)
> The items from STROBE state that you should report:   
-	Clearly define all outcomes, exposures, predictors, potential confounders, and effect modifiers. Give diagnostic criteria, if applicable.

-	EULAR Clearly deﬁne start and stop of therapy    
-	ROSES-I 7.1 The median age and range for each exposure group should be reported   
-	SBR7 Describe the theoretical and/or conceptual rationale for the design of the intervention/ exposure  
-	SBR7 Describe the intervention/exposure with sufficient detail to permit replication  
-	SBR7 Clearly describe all simulation-specific exposures, potential confounders, and effect modifiers  
-	AMS7.6 Include description of potential confounders (other than epidemiological variables)  
-	RDS 7 (a) If applicable, clearly define all outcomes, correlates, predictors, potential confounders, effect modifiers, and diagnostic criteria  
-	VET7 (c) For hypothesis-driven studies, the putative causal structure among variables should be described (a diagram is strongly encouraged)  
-	7 (a) For each variable of interest, give sources of data and details of methods of assessment (measurement). If applicable, describe comparability of assessment methods among groups and over time  
-	For each variable of interest, give sources of data and details of methods of assessment
(measurement). Describe comparability of assessment methods if there is more than one group  
-	VET7 (b) Describe the level of organization at which each variable was measured  
-	ROSES- I 7.2: Describe the potential for immunization (specify vaccine and timing of vaccination in relationship to collection of serum), if applicable, to affect the outcome measures   

### Examples of Good Reporting

### Specific examples from QA:    
-	RECORD 7.1: A complete list of codes and algorithms used to classify exposures, outcomes, confounders, and effect modiﬁers should be provided. If these cannot be reported, an explanation should be provided.  
-	STREGA 7 (b) Clearly define genetic exposures (genetic variants) using a widely-used nomenclature system. Identify variables likely to be associated with population stratification (confounding by ethnic origin)  
-	nut-7.1. Clearly deﬁne foods, food groups, nutrients, or other food components.  
-	nut-7.2. When using dietary patterns or indices, describe the methods to obtain them and their nutritional properties.
-	ROSES-I 7.4: Describe illness definitions and methods for ascertaining the presence or absence of clinical illness in subjects
-	ROSES-I 7.2: Describe the potential for immunization (specify vaccine and timing of vaccination in relationship to collection of serum), if applicable, to affect the outcome measures
-	ROSES-I 7.3: Describe any known or potential immunological cross-reactivity that may bias the outcome measures
-	STROBE-NI 7.1: state criteria used to deﬁne clinically signiﬁcant organisms for each sample type
-	AMS7.1 Specify antimicrobial usage according to: type, dosage, duration and route of administration
-	AMS7.2 Provide information using defined daily dosages (DDDs) and, in addition, other definitions closer to local reality (packages, prescriptions). Provide justification for the measurement presented
-	AMS7.3 Address antimicrobial combinations
-	AMS7.4 Explain rationale for grouping of antimicrobials
-	AMS7.5 Define time at risk for antimicrobial exposure and for resistance development
-	AMS7.7 Provide definition of resistance, multidrug resistance, including pattern of co-resistance; whether studies performed to identify location or resistance eg, plasmid, chromosome, integron, transposon
-	AMS7.8 Definition of infection and/or colonisation. If not a validated reference, provide evidence of robustness of the new definition
-	MARES7–1 Exposure: Detail the medications used, including dose(s) and route(s) of administration. If more than one medication is used, state the planned time interval between medications, preferably in hours
-	MARES7–2 Outcome: Define successful medical abortion (should most commonly be considered as successful expulsion of the intrauterine pregnancy without need for surgical intervention).
-	MARES7–3 Outcome: Define the types of medical abortion failure (e.g., ongoing pregnancy, incomplete abortion, participant symptoms). Continuing pregnancy should be defined as a viable pregnancy following treatment (to be differentiated from a non-viable [i.e., retained gestational sac]).
-	RDS7 (b) State how recruiter–recruit relationship was tracked  
-	ROSES- I 7.3: Describe any known or potential immunological cross- reactivity that may bias the outcome measures
