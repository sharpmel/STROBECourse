# Methods: Data/Measurement (8)  
> The items from STROBE state that you should report:  
-	For each variable of interest, give sources of data and details of methods of assessment (measurement). Describe comparability of assessment methods if there is more than one group.   

-	nut-8.6. Report on the validity of the dietary or nutritional assessment methods and any internal or external validation used in the study, if applicable.  
-	sbr8 In describing the details of methods of assessment, include (when applicable) the setting, instrument, simulator type, timing in relation to the intervention, along with any methods used to enhance the quality of measurements   
-	SBR8 Provide evidence to support the validity and reliability of assessment tools in this context (if available).  
-	MARES 8–2 Assessment: Explain the length of time planned to follow participants for determination of outcomes.  
-	VET(a) For each variable of interest, give sources of data and details of methods of assessment (measurement). If applicable, describe comparability of assessment methods among groups and over time  
-	VET8 (b) If a questionnaire was used to collect data, describe its development, validation, and administration  
-	VET8 (c) Describe whether or not individuals involved in data collection were blinded, when applicable  
-	VET8 (d) Describe any eﬀorts to assess the accuracy of the data (including methods used for “data cleaning” in primary research, or methods used for validating secondary data)  

**Explanation [@vandenbroucke2007]**</br>
Explanation
The way in which exposures, confounders and outcomes
were measured affects the reliability and validity of a
study. Measurement error and misclassification of exposures
or outcomes can make it more difficult to detect cause-effect
relationships, or may produce spurious relationships. Error in
measurement of potential confounders can increase the risk of
residual confounding.62,63 It is helpful, therefore, if authors
report the findings of any studies of the validity or reliability
of assessments or measurements, including details of the
reference standard that was used. Rather than simply citing
validation studies (as in the first example), we advise that
authors give the estimated validity or reliability, which can
then be used for measurement error adjustment or sensitivity
analyses (see items 12e and 17).
In addition, it is important to know if groups being
compared differed with respect to the way in which the data
were collected. This may be important for laboratory examinations
(as in the second example) and other situations. For
instance, if an interviewer first questions all the cases and
then the controls, or vice versa, bias is possible because of the
learning curve; solutions such as randomizing the order of
interviewing may avoid this problem. Information bias may
also arise if the compared groups are not given the same
diagnostic tests or if one group receives more tests of the
same kind than another (see also item 9).


<h2> Field-specific guidance:</h2>
-	AMS8.1 Describe how antimicrobial consumption data were obtained (pharmacy, patients’ charts, etc) and if it was actually used or purchased/ dispensed  

-	ME-8 Laboratory methods: report type of assay used, detection limit, quantity of biological sample used, outliers, timing in the assay procedures (when applicable) and calibration procedures or any standard used  

-	STREGA8 (b) Describe laboratory methods, including source and storage of DNA, genotyping methods and platforms (including the allele calling algorithm used, and its version), error rates and call rates.  State the laboratory/centre where genotyping was done. Describe comparability of laboratory methods if there is more than one group. Specify whether genotypes were assigned using all of the data from the study simultaneously or in smaller batches.  

-	STROME-ID 8.1: describe any methods used to detect multiple-strain infections and measure their eﬀect on the study ﬁndings  

-	nut-8.1. Describe the dietary assessment method(s), e.g., portion size estimation, number of days and items recorded, how it was developed and administered, and how quality was assured. Report if and how supplement intake was assessed  
-	nut-8.2. Describe and justify food composition data used. Explain the procedure to match food composition with consumption data. Describe the use of conversion factors, if applicable.  
-	nut-8.3. Describe the nutrient requirements, recommendations, or dietary guidelines and the evaluation approach used to compare intake with the dietary reference values, if applicable.  
-	nut-8.4. When using nutritional biomarkers, additionally use the STROBE Extension for Molecular Epidemiology (STROBE-ME). Report the type of biomarkers used and their usefulness as dietary exposure markers.  
-	nut-8.5. Describe the assessment of nondietary data (e.g., nutritional status and inﬂuencing factors) and timing of the assessment of these variables in relation to dietary assessment.  

-	ROSES-I 8.1: If relevant, describe measures taken to identify and record immunization history  

-	RDS8 (b) Describe methods to assess eligibility and reduce repeat enrollment (e.g., coupon manager software, biometrics)
