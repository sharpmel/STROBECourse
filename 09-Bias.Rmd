# Methods: Bias (9) 
> The items from STROBE state that you should report: </br>
- Describe any efforts to address potential sources of bias

-	STROME-ID 9.1: describe any eﬀorts made to address discovery or ascertainment bias  
-	strega9 (b) For quantitative outcome variables, specify if any investigation of potential bias resulting from pharmacotherapy was undertaken. If relevant, describe the nature and magnitude of the potential bias, and explain what approach was used to deal with this.  
-	nut-9. Report how bias in dietary or nutritional assessment was addressed, e.g., misreporting, changes in habits as a result of being measured, or data imputation from other sources.  
-	vet9 Describe any eﬀorts to address potential sources of bias due to confounding, selection, or information bias  

## Explanation and Elaboration [@vandenbroucke2007]
>Biased studies produce results that differ systematically from the truth (see also box 3). It is important for a reader to know what measures were taken during the conduct of a study to reduce the potential of bias. Ideally, investigators carefully consider potential sources of bias when they plan their study. At the stage of reporting, we recommend that authors always assess the likelihood of relevant biases. Specifically, the direction and magnitude of bias should be discussed and, if possible, estimated. For instance, in casecontrol studies information bias can occur, but may be reduced by selecting an appropriate control group, as in the first example.64 Differences in the medical surveillance of participants were a problem in the second example.65
</br>
Consequently, the authors provide more detail about the additional data they collected to tackle this problem. When investigators have set up quality control programs for data collection to counter a possible “drift” in measurements of variables in longitudinal studies, or to keep variability at a minimum when multiple observers are used, these should be described.
</br>
Unfortunately, authors often do not address important biases when reporting their results. Among 43 case-control
and cohort studies published from 1990 to 1994 that investigated the risk of second cancers in patients with a history of cancer, medical surveillance bias was mentioned in only 5 articles.66 A survey of reports of mental health research published during 1998 in 3 psychiatric journals found that only 13% of 392 articles mentioned response bias.67 A survey of cohort studies in stroke research found that 14 of 49 (28%) articles published from 1999 to 2003 addressed potential selection bias in the recruitment of study participants and 35 (71%) mentioned the possibility that any type of bias may have affected results.5
