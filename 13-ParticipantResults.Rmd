# Results: Participants (13)
> The items from STROBE state that you should report: 
-	Report the numbers of individuals at each stage of the study e.g., numbers potentially eligible, examined for eligibility, confirmed eligible, included in the study, completing follow up, and analyzed
-	Give reasons for nonparticipation at each stage
-	Consider use of a flow diagram

Nonspecific examples from QA:
- ME-13 Give reason for loss of biological samples at each stage   
- nut-13. Report the number of individuals excluded based on missing, incomplete, or implausible dietary/nutritional data.  
- RDS(g) Consider reporting estimated design effect for outcomes of interest  
- 13 (c) Consider use of a ﬂow diagram, a diagram of the organizational structure or both  
**Explanation [@vandenbroucke2007]**</br>
Detailed information on the process of recruiting study
participants is important for several reasons. Those included
in a study often differ in relevant ways from the target
population to which results are applied. This may result in
estimates of prevalence or incidence that do not reflect the
experience of the target population. For example, people who
agreed to participate in a postal survey of sexual behaviour
attended church less often, had less conservative sexual
attitudes and earlier age at first sexual intercourse, and were
more likely to smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol than people
who refused.130 These differences suggest that postal surveys
may overestimate sexual liberalism and activity in the population.
Such response bias (see box 3) can distort exposuredisease
associations if associations differ between those eligible
for the study and those included in the study. As another
example, the association between young maternal age and
leukemia in offspring, which has been observed in some
case-control studies,131,132 was explained by differential participation
of young women in case and control groups. Young
women with healthy children were less likely to participate
than those with unhealthy children.133 Although low participation
does not necessarily compromise the validity of a
study, transparent information on participation and reasons
for nonparticipation is essential. Also, as there are no universally
agreed definitions for participation, response or follow-
up rates, readers need to understand how authors calculated
such proportions.134
Ideally, investigators should give an account of the numbers
of individuals considered at each stage of recruiting study
participants, from the choice of a target population to the
inclusion of participants’ data in the analysis. Depending on the
type of study, this may include the number of individuals
considered to be potentially eligible, the number assessed for
eligibility, the number found to be eligible, the number included
in the study, the number examined, the number followed up and
the number included in the analysis. Information on different
sampling units may be required, if sampling of study participants
is carried out in two or more stages as in the example above
(multistage sampling). In case-control studies, we advise that
authors describe the flow of participants separately for case and
control groups.135 Controls can sometimes be selected from
several sources, including, for example, hospitalized patients
and community dwellers. In this case, we recommend a separate
account of the numbers of participants for each type of control
group. Olson and colleagues proposed useful reporting guidelines
for controls recruited through random-digit dialling and
other methods.136
A recent survey of epidemiological studies published in
10 general epidemiology, public health and medical journals
found that some information regarding participation was
provided in 47 of 107 case-control studies (59%), 49 of 154
cohort studies (32%), and 51 of 86 cross-sectional studies
(59%).137 Incomplete or absent reporting of participation and
nonparticipation in epidemiological studies was also documented
in two other surveys of the literature.4,5 Finally, there
is evidence that participation in epidemiological studies may
have declined in recent decades,137,138 which underscores the
need for transparent reporting.139
participated
in a study or why they were excluded from statistical
analyses helps readers judge whether the study population
was representative of the target population and whether bias
was possibly introduced. For example, in a cross-sectional
health survey, non-participation due to reasons unlikely to be
related to health status (for example, the letter of invitation was
not delivered because of an incorrect address) will affect
the precision of estimates but will probably not introduce
bias. Conversely, if many individuals opt out of the survey
because of illness, or perceived good health, results may
underestimate or overestimate the prevalence of ill health
in the population.
An informative and well-structured flow diagram can
readily and transparently convey information that might otherwise
require a lengthy description,142 as in the example
above. The diagram may usefully include the main results,
such as the number of events for the primary outcome. While
we recommend the use of a flow diagram, particularly for
complex observational studies, we do not propose a specific
format for the diagram.


<h2> Field-specific guidance:</h2>
- STROME-ID 13.1: Report numbers of participants and samples at each stage of the study, including the number of samples obtained, the number typed, and the number yielding data  
- STROME-ID 13.2: if the study investigates groups of genetically indistinguishable pathogens (molecular clusters), state the sampling fraction, the distribution of cluster sizes, and the study population turnover, if known  

- RECORD 13.1: Describe in detail the selection of the persons included in the study (i.e., study population selection), including ﬁltering based on data quality, data availability, and linkage. The selection of included persons can be described in the text and/or by means of the study ﬂow diagram. 

- STREGA13a Report numbers of individuals in whom genotyping was attempted and numbers of individuals in whom genotyping was successful.  

- STROBE-NI 13.1: see ﬁgure 2 for suggested components of a ﬂow diagram for neonatal infections  

- MARES13a-1 Report the number of participants who started medical abortion treatment and the number who did not complete any follow-up for each cohort and by gestational age.  
- MARES13a-2 Report the number of participants used in the denominator for outcome evaluation for each cohort and by gestational age, which most commonly will be the number of women with any follow-up.  
- MARES13a-3 Include a description of the number of women who used the drug(s) as planned in the protocol (treatment adherence)  
- MARES13a-4 When more than one drug is used (e.g. mifepristone and a prostaglandin analog), the actual time interval between the agents should be reported, preferably in hours.  

- RDS13 (d) Report number of coupons issued and returned  
- RDS13 (e) Report number of recruits by seed and number of RDS recruitment waves for each seed. Consider showing graph of entire recruitment network  
- RDS13 (f) Report recruitment challenges (e.g., commercial exchange of coupons, imposters, duplicate recruits) and how addressed  

- VET13 (a) Report the numbers of owners/managers and animals at each stage of study and at each relevant level of organization - e.g, numbers eligible, included in the study, completing follow-up, and analyzed  
- VET13 (b) Give reasons for non-participation at each stage and at each relevant level of organization
