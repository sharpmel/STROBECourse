# Results: Outcome Data (15)
The items from STROBE state that you should report: 
•	Cohort study Report numbers of outcome events or summary measures over time
•	Case-control study Report numbers in each exposure category, or summary measures of exposure
•	Cross-sectional study Report numbers of outcome events or summary measures

3.15.2 – Objectives
Specific examples from QA:
•	STREGA15 cohort Report outcomes (phenotypes) for each genotype category over time
•	STREGA15c-c Report numbers in each genotype category
•	STREGA15 cross-sectional Report outcomes (phenotypes) for each genotype category
•	STROBE-NI 15.1: report the number (and the proportion) of samples microbiologically tested (including lumbar punctures for meningitis cases); the number (and the proportion) that were positive (including thresholds for detection, where applicable); all isolates obtained (including clinically signiﬁcant and nonsigniﬁcant); and antimicrobial susceptibilities of pathogens, where done
•	STROBE-NI 15.2: report the number (and the proportion) of babies with microbiologically proven infection (and number of infections per baby), and include this in the ﬂ ow chart (see ﬁgure 2)
•	STROBE-NI 15.3: report infections by day, for days 0–6. State age categories, if used, deﬁning early-onset and late-onset infection (eg, <72 h and ≥72 h, respectively)
•	STROBE-NI 15.4: report deaths and any subanalyses by risk groups

Nonspecific examples from QA:
•	EULAR Consider the use of a tabular or graphical presentation (Kaplan–Meier, cumulative incidence plot) of the outcome over time for the exposed and comparison cohort
•	VET15 (a) Report outcomes as appropriate for the study design and summarize at all relevant levels of organization
•	VET15 (b) For proportions and rates, report the numerator and denominator
•	VET15 (c) For continuous outcomes, report the number of observations and a measure of variability
