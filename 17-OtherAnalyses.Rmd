# Results: Other Analyses (17)
> The items from STROBE state that you should report: 
-	Report other analyses done e.g., analyses of subgroups and interactions, and sensitivity analyses

-	EULAR(A) Consider performing analyses to explore possible effect modiﬁcation
-	EULAR(B) Consider performing sensitivity analyses for differing deﬁnitions of exposure (item 12A) and outcome or different statistical models, if applicable
-	strega17 (c) If detailed results are available elsewhere, state how they can be accessed.
-	nut-17. Report any sensitivity analysis (e.g., exclusion of misreporters or outliers) and data imputation, if applicable.
-	vet17 Report other analyses done, such as sensitivity/ robustness analysis and analysis of subgroups



Specific examples from QA:
•	STREGA17 (b) If numerous genetic exposures (genetic variants) were examined, summarize results from all analyses undertaken.
•	AMS17.1 Report subgroup analysis by type of patients and type of microorganism, if applicable
•	RDS17 Report other analyses done—for example, analyses of subgroups and interactions, sensitivity analyses, different RDS estimators and definitions of personal network size
