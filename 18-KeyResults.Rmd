# Discussion: Key Results (18)
> The items from STROBE state that you should report: 
-	Summarize key results with reference to study objectives

## Explanation and Elaboration
> It is good practice to begin the discussion with a short summary of the main findings of the study. The short summary reminds readers of the main findings and may help them assess whether the subsequent interpretation and implications offered by the authors are supported by the findings.</br>

**Examples of Good Reporting**</br>
“We hypothesized that ethnic minority status would be associated with higher levels of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, but that the associations would be explained substantially by socioeconomic status (SES). Our hypothesis was
not confirmed. After adjustment for age and SES, highly significant differences in body mass index, blood pressure, diabetes, and physical inactivity remained between white women and both black and Mexican American women. In addition, we found large differences in CVD risk factors by SES, a finding that illustrates the high-risk status of both ethnic minority women as well as white women with low SES.”199
