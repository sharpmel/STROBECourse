# Discussion: Limitations (19)
> The items from STROBE state that you should report: 
-	Discuss limitations of the study, taking into account sources of potential bias or imprecision.
-	Discuss both direction and magnitude of any potential bias

Example
“Since the prevalence of counseling increases with increasing levels of obesity, our estimates may overestimate the true prevalence. Telephone surveys also may overestimate the true prevalence of counseling. Although persons without telephones have similar levels of overweight as persons with telephones, persons without telephones tend to be less educated, a factor associated with lower levels of counseling in our study. Also, of concern is the potential bias caused by those who refused to participate as well as those who refused to respond to questions about weight. Furthermore, because data were collected cross-sectionally, we cannot infer that counseling preceded a patient’s attempt to lose weight.”200
Explanation
The identification and discussion of the limitations of a study are an essential part of scientific reporting. It is important
not only to identify the sources of bias and confounding that could have affected results, but also to discuss the
relative importance of different biases, including the likely direction and magnitude of any potential bias (see also box 3,
item 9).
Authors should also discuss any imprecision of the results. Imprecision may arise in connection with several aspects of a study, including the study size (item 10) and the measurement of exposures, confounders and outcomes (item 8). The inability to precisely measure true values of an exposure tends to result in bias towards unity: the less precisely a risk factor is measured, the greater the bias. This effect has been described as ‘attenuation’,201,202 or more recently as ‘regression dilution bias’.203 However, when correlated risk factors are measured with different degrees of imprecision, the adjusted relative risk associated with them can be biased towards or away from unity.204–206
When discussing limitations, authors may compare the
study being presented with other studies in the literature in
terms of validity, generalizability and precision. In this approach,
each study can be viewed as contribution to the
literature, not as a stand-alone basis for inference and action.
207 Surprisingly, the discussion of important limitations
of a study is sometimes omitted from published reports. A
survey of authors who had published original research articles
in The Lancet found that important weaknesses of the study
were reported by the investigators in the survey questionnaires,
but not in the published article.192

Nonspecific examples from QA: 
•	ME-19 Describe main limitations in laboratory procedures
•	EULAR(A) Selection factors for treatment should be considered and discussed 
•	EULAR(B) Discuss implication of unmeasured/residual confounding
•	RECORD 19.1: Discuss the implications of using data that were not created or collected to answer the speciﬁc research question(s). Include discussion of misclassiﬁcation bias, unmeasured confounding, missing data, and changing eligibility over time, as they pertain to the study being reported
•	nut-19. Describe the main limitations of the data sources and assessment methods used and implications for the interpretation of the ﬁndings.
•	SBR19 Specifically discuss the limitations of SBR.
•	VET19 Discuss strengths and limitations of the study, taking into account sources of potential bias or imprecision. Discuss both direction and magnitude of any potential bias




<h2> Field-specific guidance:</h2>
•	STROME-ID 19.1: consider alternative explanations for ﬁndings when transmission chains are being investigated, and report the consistency between molecular and epidemiological evidence 
•	STROBE-NI 19.1: discuss sources of recruitment bias, particularly regarding the period of time shortly after birth. State source of denominator data and discuss possible related biases

AMS19.1 Provide description of sources of selection bias, including infection control measures, audit and confounding

**Seroepidemiologic studies for influenza [@horby2017]**
ROSES-I 19.1 Discuss limitations and strengths of the study with reference to Table 1
