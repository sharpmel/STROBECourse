# Discussion: Interpretation (20)
> The items from STROBE state that you should report: 
-	Give a cautious overall interpretation of results considering objectives, limitations, multiplicity of analyses, results from similar studies, and other relevant evidence

Nonspecific examples from QA:
•	nut-20. Report the nutritional relevance of the ﬁndings, given the complexity of diet or nutrition as an exposure.






•	ME-20 Give an interpretation of results in terms of a priori biological plausibility
•	ROSES-I 20.1: Discuss the interpretation of the results in the context of known or potential cross-reactivity
