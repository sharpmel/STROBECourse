# Other: Funding 
> The items from STROBE state that you should report: 
-	Give the source of funding and the role of the funders for the present study and, if applicable, for the original study on which the present article is based

Explanation
Some journals require authors to disclose the presence or
absence of financial and other conflicts of interest.100,218 Several
investigations show strong associations between the source of
funding and the conclusions of research articles.219–222 The
conclusions in randomized trials recommended the experimental
drug as the drug of choice much more often (odds ratio 5.3) if
the trial was funded by for-profit organisations, even after
adjustment for the effect size.223 Other studies document the
influence of the tobacco and telecommunication industries on
the research they funded.224–227 There are also examples of
undue influence when the sponsor is governmental or a nonprofit
organization.
Authors or funders may have conflicts of interest that
influence any of the following: the design of the study228;
choice of exposures,228,229 outcomes,230 statistical methods,
231 and selective publication of outcomes230 and studies.
232 Consequently, the role of the funders should be described
in detail: in what part of the study they took direct
responsibility (eg, design, data collection, analysis, drafting
of the manuscript, decision to publish).100 Other sources of
undue influence include employers (eg, university administrators
for academic researchers and government supervisors,
especially political appointees, for government researchers),
advisory committees, litigants, and special interest groups.
