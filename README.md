# Educational Expansion to the STROBE Reporting Guideline
This repository holds all of the information for an educational expansion of the [Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline](http://strobe-statement.com). STROBE was created in 2007 and provides guidance on the minimal items to report when one is writing up the results of an observational study (i.e., case-control, cohort, cross-sectional). This book is designed to allow epidemiologists, statisticians, and others to share educational resources related to the items on the STROBE checklist.
