# Educational Expansion to the STROBE Reporting Guideline
This repository holds all of the information for an educational expansion of the [Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline](http://strobe-statement.com). STROBE was created in 2007 and provides guidance on the minimal items to report when one is writing up the results of an observational study (i.e., case-control, cohort, cross-sectional). This book is designed to allow epidemiologists, statisticians, and others to share educational resources related to the items on the STROBE checklist. 

The numbered [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) files within this repository knit together using the [R Bookdown package](https://bookdown.org/) to form an online book/website based on the STROBE Statement. 

All content is stored within this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sharpmel/STROBECourse). It is managed by [Melissa Sharp](https://melissaksharp.wordpress.com/), a doctoral student working on STROBE. She  is reachable via [e-mail](mailto:melissaksharp@gmail.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sharpmelk).
