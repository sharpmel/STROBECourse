## Frequently Asked Questions
### How can I add citations and references? (https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)
Citations go inside square brackets and are separated by semicolons. 
  Each citation has a key which is composed of: 
    @ and a citation identifier (e.g., @smith2001, @johnson2001-a)
  In text, citations should be written as: 
    TEXT TEXT [@smith2001; @smith2002, ch. 1]
  A minus sign ( - ) before the @ will suppress mention of the author in the citation. This can be useful when the author is already    mentioned in the text. (e.g., Research from Smith et al. foundâ€¦ [-@smith2001].)
