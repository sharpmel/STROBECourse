Neonatal infections are estimated to account for a quarter of the 2·8 million annual neonatal deaths, as well as approximately 3\% of all disability-adjusted life-years. Despite this burden, few data are available on incidence, aetiology, and outcomes, particularly regarding impairment. We aimed to develop guidelines for improved scientific reporting of observational neonatal infection studies, to increase comparability and to strengthen research in this area. This checklist, Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology for Newborn Infection (STROBE- NI), is an extension of the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) statement. STROBE-NI was developed following systematic reviews of published literature (1996–2015), compilation of more than 130 potential reporting recommendations, and circulation of a survey to relevant professionals worldwide, eliciting responses from 147 professionals from 37 countries. An international consensus meeting of 18 participants (with expertise in infectious diseases, neonatology, microbiology, epidemiology, and statistics) identified priority recommendations for reporting, additional to the STROBE statement. Implementation of these STROBE-NI recommendations, and linked checklist, aims to improve scientific reporting of neonatal infection studies, increasing data utility and allowing meta-analyses and pathogen-specific burden estimates to inform global policy and new interventions, including maternal vaccines.},

	abstract = {The validity and practical utility of observational medical research depends critically on good study design, excellent data quality, appropriate statistical methods and accurate interpretation of results. Statistical methodology has seen substantial development in recent times. Unfortunately, many of these methodological developments are ignored in practice. Consequently, design and analysis of observational studies often exhibit serious weaknesses. The lack of guidance on vital practical issues discourages many applied researchers from using more sophisticated and possibly more appropriate methods when analyzing observational studies. Furthermore, many analyses are conducted by researchers with a relatively weak statistical background and limited experience in using statistical methodology and software. Consequently, even ‘standard’ analyses reported in the medical literature are often flawed, casting doubt on their results and conclusions. An efficient way to help researchers to keep up with recent methodological developments is to develop guidance documents that are spread to the research community at large., These observations led to the initiation of the strengthening analytical thinking for observational studies (STRATOS) initiative, a large collaboration of experts in many different areas of biostatistical research. The objective of STRATOS is to provide accessible and accurate guidance in the design and analysis of observational studies. The guidance is intended for applied statisticians and other data analysts with varying levels of statistical education, experience and interests., In this article, we introduce the STRATOS initiative and its main aims, present the need for guidance documents and outline the planned approach and progress so far. We encourage other biostatisticians to become involved.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To systematically review observational studies on medical interventions to determine the quality of reporting of confounding.
METHODS: Articles on observational studies on medical interventions in five general medical journals and five epidemiological journals published between January 2004 and April 2007 were systematically reviewed. All relevant items pertaining to confounding bias were scored for each article. The overall quality of reporting was determined with an 8-point score.
RESULTS: The MEDLINE search resulted in 2993 publications, and 174 (5.8\%) articles were included in the analysis. In the majority of studies ({\textgreater}98\%), the potential for confounding bias was reported. Details on the selection and inclusion of observed confounders were reported in 10\% and 51\%, respectively. The potential for unobserved confounding was reported in 60\%, and 9\% commented on the potential effect of such remaining confounding. The quality of reporting of confounding score was mediocre (a median score of 4 points; interquartile range 3 to 5), and scores were similar in all years.
CONCLUSION: The quality of reporting of confounding in articles on observational medical intervention studies was poor. However, the STROBE statement for reporting of observational studies may considerably impact the reporting of such studies.},

	issn = {0378-7346},
	doi = {52882},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To classify and compare articles, based on the study design, in four leading US obstetrics and gynecology journals.
METHODS: One year of each journal, American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (AJOG), Obstetrics and Gynecology (O\&G), Gynecologic Oncology (GO), and Fertility and Sterility (F\&S), beginning May 1997, was reviewed. Supplementary issues were excluded from review. The percentage of articles devoted to observational versus experimental study design was determined, and the quality of evidence was assessed including how heavily randomized controlled trials were represented versus other study designs.
RESULTS: 1,517 articles were reviewed. The average percentage of clinical research articles was 90.4. The percentage of animal studies were 10.7 (AJOG), 1.1 (O\&G), 1.1 (GO) and 4.2 (F\&S) (chi(2) p {\textless} 0.001). There were 5.3, 1.9, 6.5, and 7.5\% basic science articles, respectively (chi(2) p = 0.007). The average percentage of observational articles was 68.2 and that of experimental articles was 14.1. The percentages of total articles classified as controlled experimental were 10.9 (AJOG), 14.6 (O\&G), 5.1 (GO), and 15.2 (F\&S) (chi(2) p = 0.01). There were 8.7, 11.1, 3.3 and 9.5\% randomized controlled trials, respectively (chi(2) p = 0.008).
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of research reviewed was clinical, and more than half of the articles were observational. Under the US Preventative Services Task Force rating system, the randomized control trial is given the highest rating - class I evidence. The drive toward evidence-based clinical practice may not be fully supported by researchers in obstetrics and gynecology, as reflected by submissions to and publications in the major obstetrics and gynecology journals.},

	issn = {0022-5347},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: We provide a systematic assessment of the quality and accuracy of statistical reporting in the urology literature.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All original research publications with adult human subjects in a single issue (August 2004) of 4 leading urology journals were identified for formal review. A standardized evaluation form was developed in consultation with an experienced biostatistician and subsequently tested. Two independent reviewers with at least 1 year of formal training in research design and biostatistics who were blinded to authors and institutions reviewed each article. Discrepancies were settled by consensus and/or adjudication by the biostatistician.
RESULTS: Of the 169 articles screened 97 met eligibility criteria for review. Cohort (43 of 97 or 44\%) or cross-sectional (28 of 97 or 29\%) designs comprised the majority of these studies. Only 10 randomized clinical trials (12.4\%) were identified. Statistical tests were identified in 83 studies (93\%). Overall 69 of 83 studies (71\%) providing statistical comparisons had at least 1 statistical error, including using the wrong test for the data type in 28\%, inappropriate use of a parametric test in 22\% and failure to account for multiple comparisons in 65\%. In studies applying multivariate analysis (29\%) over fitting the model with too many variables was the most common statistical flaw (39\%).
CONCLUSIONS: This formal review suggests that statistical methods are often used inappropriately in the urology literature, thereby, potentially undermining the validity of study results and conclusions. An effort to raise the awareness of appropriate statistical techniques through postgraduate education appears indicated.},

Using a Likert-style survey administered pre- and postcourse, we found significant changes in students’ confidence in their ability to read and analyze primary literature, self-assessed understanding of the nature of science, and epistemological beliefs (e.g., their sense of whether knowledge is certain and scientific talent innate). Thus, within a single semester, the inexpensive C.R.E.A.T.E. method can shift not just students’ analytical abilities and understanding of scientists as people, but can also positively affect students’ confidence with analysis of primary literature, their insight into the processes of science, and their beliefs about learning.},

	abstract = {Objectives Appropriate reporting is central to the application of findings from research to clinical practice. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) recommendations consist of a checklist of 22 items that provide guidance on the reporting of cohort, case–control and cross-sectional studies, in order to facilitate critical appraisal and interpretation of results. STROBE was published in October 2007 in several journals including The Lancet, BMJ, Annals of Internal Medicine and PLoS Medicine. Within the framework of the revision of the STROBE recommendations, the authors examined the context and circumstances in which the STROBE statement was used in the past.
Design The authors searched the Web of Science database in August 2010 for articles which cited STROBE and examined a random sample of 100 articles using a standardised, piloted data extraction form. The use of STROBE in observational studies and systematic reviews (including meta-analyses) was classified as appropriate or inappropriate. The use of STROBE to guide the reporting of observational studies was considered appropriate. Inappropriate uses included the use of STROBE as a tool to assess the methodological quality of studies or as a guideline on how to design and conduct studies.
Results The authors identified 640 articles that cited STROBE. In the random sample of 100 articles, about half were observational studies (32\%) or systematic reviews (19\%). Comments, editorials and letters accounted for 15\%, methodological articles for 8\%, and recommendations and narrative reviews for 26\% of articles. Of the 32 observational studies, 26 (81\%) made appropriate use of STROBE, and three uses (10\%) were considered inappropriate. Among 19 systematic reviews, 10 (53\%) used STROBE inappropriately as a tool to assess study quality.
Conclusions The STROBE reporting recommendations are frequently used inappropriately in systematic reviews and meta-analyses as an instrument to assess the methodological quality of observational studies.},

	abstract = {Objective To investigate the effect of an additional review based on reporting guidelines such as STROBE and CONSORT on quality of manuscripts.
Design Masked randomised trial.
Population Original research manuscripts submitted to the Medicina Clínica journal from May 2008 to April 2009 and considered suitable for publication.
Intervention Control group: conventional peer reviews alone. Intervention group: conventional review plus an additional review looking for missing items from reporting guidelines.
Outcomes Manuscript quality, assessed with a 5 point Likert scale (primary: overall quality; secondary: average quality of specific items in paper). Main analysis compared groups as allocated, after adjustment for baseline factors (analysis of covariance); sensitivity analysis compared groups as reviewed. Adherence to reviewer suggestions assessed with Likert scale.
Results Of 126 consecutive papers receiving conventional review, 34 were not suitable for publication. The remaining 92 papers were allocated to receive conventional reviews alone (n=41) or additional reviews (n=51). Four papers assigned to the conventional review group deviated from protocol; they received an additional review based on reporting guidelines. We saw an improvement in manuscript quality in favour of the additional review group (comparison as allocated, 0.25, 95\% confidence interval –0.05 to 0.54; as reviewed, 0.33, 0.03 to 0.63). More papers with additional reviews than with conventional reviews alone improved from baseline (22 (43\%) v eight (20\%), difference 23.6\% (3.2\% to 44.0\%), number needed to treat 4.2 (from 2.3 to 31.2), relative risk 2.21 (1.10 to 4.44)). Authors in the additional review group adhered more to suggestions from conventional reviews than to those from additional reviews (average increase 0.43 Likert points (0.19 to 0.67)).
Conclusions Additional reviews based on reporting guidelines improve manuscript quality, although the observed effect was smaller than hypothesised and not definitively demonstrated. Authors adhere more to suggestions from conventional reviews than to those from additional reviews, showing difficulties in adhering to high methodological standards at the latest research phases. To boost paper quality and impact, authors should be aware of future requirements of reporting guidelines at the very beginning of their study.

	abstract = {Purpose
The vast majority of epidemiological studies in cancer are observational. However, inadequate reporting of the published observational studies (OS) may restrict the generalizability and credibility of study results. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reporting quality of OS concerning cancer.
Methods
PubMed was searched for systematic reviews (SRs) of OS involving cancer published from January 2008 through February 2009. The citations provided in the SRs were evaluated for their reporting quality according to the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) statement, a checklist of items that are considered essential for good reporting of OS. The evaluation was focused on 25 methodological items/sub-items. The effect of journals' ranking in quality of reporting was also evaluated.
Results
The search identified 244 eligible OS included in seven SRs. Nine items/sub-items were reported by more than 90\% of studies and 16 items/sub-items were reported by more than 70\%. Some essential methodological aspects of OS (such as matching, absolute risks, missing data and flow diagram) were underreported. Significant differences were found among the seven SRs in the majority of the items. High and lower ranked journals were different only in reporting of results estimates and precision.
Conclusions
The quality of reporting in OS in cancer was considered satisfactory, although certain items were underreported. Further improvement of reporting may enhance the validity of observational research.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Poor quality of reporting of confounding has been observed in observational studies prior the STrenghtening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement, a reporting guideline for observational studies. We assessed whether the reporting of confounding improved after the STROBE statement.
Study Design and Setting
We searched MEDLINE for all articles about observational cohort and case-control studies on interventions with a hypothesized beneficial effect in five general medical and five epidemiologic journals published between January 2010 and December 2012. We abstracted data for the baseline period before the publication of the STROBE statement (January 2004-April 2007) from a prior study. Six relevant items related to confounding were scored for each article. A comparison of the median number of items reported in both periods was made.
Results
In total, 174 articles published before and 220 articles published after the STROBE statement were included. The median number reported items was similar before and after the publication of the STROBE statement [median, 4; interquartile range [IQR], 3-5 vs. median, 4; IQR, 3.75-5]. However, the distribution of the number of reported items shifted somewhat to the right (P= 0.01).
Conclusion
Although the quality of reporting of confounding improved in certain aspects, the overall quality remains suboptimal.},

	issn = {1531-6564},
	doi = {10.1016/j.jhsa.2013.05.008},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: To use the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement checklist to critically evaluate the change in quality of observational trial reporting in the Journal of Hand Surgery American between 2005 and 2011.
METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of observational studies published in the Journal of Hand Surgery American was designed to sample 2 6-month periods of publication (March 2005 to August 2005 and June 2011 to November 2011). Fifty-one items were extracted from the STROBE statement for evaluation. Overall STROBE compliance rates for articles and specific checklist items were determined. Final compliance percentages from each period were compared by Student t-testing. Changes in item compliance over time were quantified.
RESULTS: Overall compliance with the STROBE statement was 38\% (range, 10\%-54\%) in 2005 and 58\% (range, 39\%-85\%) for 2011 manuscripts representing a significant improvement. Seventy-five percent or greater of articles (2005/2011) provided the explicit reporting of background (100\%/97\%), follow-up time (85\%/94\%), overall interpretation of data (100\%/94\%), and results of similar studies (95\%/89\%). Twenty-five percent or less of articles provided the study design in the abstract (10\%/20\%), a clear description of the study's setting (10\%/23\%), the handling of missing data (0\%/6\%), the potential directions of bias (5\%/11\%), and the use of a power analysis (0\%/17\%). Eighty-six percent (44/51) of items were more frequently satisfied in 2011 articles than in 2005 publications. Absolute increases in compliance rates of 40\% or greater were noted in 10 items (20\%) with no worsening in compliance for an individual item over 6\%.
CONCLUSIONS: The overall quality of the reporting of observational trials in the Journal of Hand Surgery American improved from 2005 to 2011. Current observational trials in hand surgery could still benefit from increased reporting of methodological details including the use of power analyses, the handling of missing data, and consideration of potential bias.

	abstract = {It is estimated that in 2009, more than 3 million kilograms of antimicrobials were administered to human patients in the United States. While the life-saving benefits of antimicrobials are indisputable, the consequences of use and misuse must also be considered. Major concerns related to the use of antimicrobials are increasing resistance, higher incidence of Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection (CDI) and increased healthcare costs (including costs related to adverse events associated with antimicrobial use). While much of the discussion focuses on overuse, there is also evidence of adverse outcomes associated with inadequate antimicrobial therapy. Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) are a focused effort by a health care system, a hospital, or a portion of a hospital (e.g., an intensive care unit) to optimize the use of antimicrobial agents. The goals of an ASP are to improve patient outcomes, reduce adverse consequences, reduce or prevent an increase in antimicrobial resistance, and deliver cost-effective therapy. The emphasis is on appropriate selection, dosing, route, and duration of antimicrobial therapy. The purpose of this review is to synthesize the evidence about the effectiveness of antimicrobial stewardship programs implemented in hospital settings. We focus on ASPs including one or more of the following components: prospective audit and feedback, formulary restriction, pre-authorization of prescriptions, guidelines for prescribing and/or modifying therapy, computerized decision support, or laboratory testing. The topic was nominated by Matthew Goetz, MD, Chief, Infectious Diseases, VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, on behalf of the VA Antimicrobial Stewardship Task Force, and is intended to provide a summary of the evidence on inpatient antimicrobial stewardship programs to guide clinical practice and policy within the Veterans Healthcare System.},

In some world regions, it seems increasingly likely that most rare diseases will be managed through a network of centres of expertise, and e-consultation systems may become a vital component of the service provided by these networks. Long-distance consultation across geographical and national boundaries has been used between colleagues in DSD for many years. However, the development of a robust and secure e-consultation service within the international DSD community appears to be timely. It will extend the current database and e-learning facilities, and should be achieved with the objective of providing expert opinion on a worldwide basis. It is proposed to install a steering committee to oversee the various practical, legal and cultural issues setting standards on data collection and exchange. The opportunity to broaden access to healthcare for all DSD patients and to widen discussion across the DSD community is valuable, and it is the view of the authors that this should be pursued and developed.},

	abstract = {Introduction
The development of reporting guidelines over the past 20 years represents a major advance in scholarly publishing with recent evidence showing positive impacts. Whilst over 350 reporting guidelines exist there are few that are specific to surgery. Here we describe the development of the STROCSS guideline (Strengthening the Reporting of Cohort Studies in Surgery).
Methods
and analysis: We published our protocol apriori. Current guidelines for case series (PROCESS), cohort studies (STROBE) and randomised controlled trials (CONSORT) were analysed to compile items which were used as baseline material for developing a list of suitable items for surgical cohort guidelines. These were then put forward in a Delphi consensus exercise to an expert panel of 74 surgeons and academics via Google Forms.
Results
The Delphi exercise was completed by 62\% (46/74) of the participants. All the items were passed in a single round to create a STROCSS guideline consisting of 17 items. This guideline can also be used for cross-sectional and case-control studies.
Conclusion
We present the STROCSS guideline for surgical cohort, cross-sectional and case-control studies consisting of a 17-item checklist. We hope its use will increase the transparency and reporting quality of such studies. We encourage authors, reviewers, journal editors and publishers to adopt these guidelines.},

	abstract = {Introduction Complete reporting assists readers in confirming the methodological rigor and validity of findings and allows replication. The reporting quality of observational functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies involving clinical participants is unclear.  Objectives We sought to determine the quality of reporting in observational fMRI studies involving clinical participants.  Methods We searched OVID MEDLINE for fMRI studies in six leading journals between January 2010 and December 2011.Three independent reviewers abstracted data from articles using an 83-item checklist adapted from the guidelines proposed by Poldrack et al. (Neuroimage 2008; 40: 409–14). We calculated the percentage of articles reporting each item of the checklist and the percentage of reported items per article.  Results A random sample of 100 eligible articles was included in the study. Thirty-one items were reported by fewer than 50\% of the articles and 13 items were reported by fewer than 20\% of the articles. The median percentage of reported items per article was 51\% (ranging from 30\% to 78\%). Although most articles reported statistical methods for within-subject modeling (92\%) and for between-subject group modeling (97\%), none of the articles reported observed effect sizes for any negative finding (0\%). Few articles reported justifications for fixed-effect inferences used for group modeling (3\%) and temporal autocorrelations used to account for within-subject variances and correlations (18\%). Other under-reported areas included whether and how the task design was optimized for efficiency (22\%) and distributions of inter-trial intervals (23\%).  Conclusions This study indicates that substantial improvement in the reporting of observational clinical fMRI studies is required. Poldrack et al.'s guidelines provide a means of improving overall reporting quality. Nonetheless, these guidelines are lengthy and may be at odds with strict word limits for publication; creation of a shortened-version of Poldrack's checklist that contains the most relevant items may be useful in this regard.},

	issn = {1933-0693},
	doi = {10.3171/2014.5.JNS132329},
	abstract = {OBJECT: Observational studies, such as cohort and case-control studies, are valuable instruments in evidence-based medicine. Case-control studies, in particular, are becoming increasingly popular in the neurosurgical literature due to their low cost and relative ease of execution; however, no one has yet systematically assessed these types of studies for quality in methodology and reporting.
METHODS: The authors performed a literature search using PubMed/MEDLINE to identify all studies that explicitly identified themselves as "case-control" and were published in the JNS Publishing Group journals (Journal of Neurosurgery, Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics, Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine, and Neurosurgical Focus) or Neurosurgery. Each paper was evaluated for 22 descriptive variables and then categorized as having either met or missed the basic definition of a case-control study. All studies that evaluated risk factors for a well-defined outcome were considered true case-control studies. The authors sought to identify key features or phrases that were or were not predictive of a true case-control study. Those papers that satisfied the definition were further evaluated using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist.
RESULTS: The search detected 67 papers that met the inclusion criteria, of which 32 (48\%) represented true case-control studies. The frequency of true case-control studies has not changed with time. Use of odds ratios (ORs) and logistic regression (LR) analysis were strong positive predictors of true case-control studies (for odds ratios, OR 15.33 and 95\% CI 4.52-51.97; for logistic regression analysis, OR 8.77 and 95\% CI 2.69-28.56). Conversely, negative predictors included focus on a procedure/intervention (OR 0.35, 95\% CI 0.13-0.998) and use of the word "outcome" in the Results section (OR 0.23, 95\% CI 0.082-0.65). After exclusion of nested case-control studies, the negative correlation between focus on a procedure/intervention and true case-control studies was strengthened (OR 0.053, 95\% CI 0.0064-0.44). There was a trend toward a negative association between the use of survival analysis or Kaplan-Meier curves and true case-control studies (OR 0.13, 95\% CI 0.015-1.12). True case-control studies were no more likely than their counterparts to use a potential study design "expert" (OR 1.50, 95\% CI 0.57-3.95). The overall average STROBE score was 72\% (range 50-86\%). Examples of reporting deficiencies were reporting of bias (28\%), missing data (55\%), and funding (44\%).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this analysis show that the majority of studies in the neurosurgical literature that identify themselves as "case-control" studies are, in fact, labeled incorrectly. Positive and negative predictors were identified. The authors provide several recommendations that may reverse the incorrect and inappropriate use of the term "case-control" and improve the quality of design and reporting of true case-control studies in neurosurgery.},

Aims To assess the quality of methodological reporting of case–control studies published in general psychiatric journals.
Method All the case–control studies published over a 2-year period in the six general psychiatric journals with impact factors of more than 3 were assessed by a group of psychiatrists with training in epidemiology using a structured assessment devised for the purpose. The measured study quality was compared across type of exposure and journal.
Results The reporting of methods in the 408 identified papers was generally poor, with basic information about recruitment of participants often absent. Reduction of selection bias was described best in the `pencil and paper' studies and worst in the genetic studies. Neuroimaging studies reported the most safeguards against information bias. Measurement of exposure was reported least well in studies determining the exposure with a biological test.
Conclusions Poor reporting of recruitment strategies threatens the validity of reported results and reduces the generalisability of studies.},

The aim of many longitudinal studies is to estimate the causal effect of a time varying exposure on an outcome that requires adjusting for time varying confounding. Time varying confounding affected by previous exposure often occurs in practice, but it is usually adjusted for by using conventional analytical methods such as time dependent Cox regression, random effects models, or generalised estimating equations, which are known to provide biased effect estimates in this setting.

Background

Interactive Health Communication Applications (IHCAs) are computer-based, usually web-based, information packages for patients that combine health information with at least one of social support, decision support, or behaviour change support. These are innovations in health care and their effects on health are uncertain.

Objectives
Objectives

To assess the effects of IHCAs for people with chronic disease.

Search methods
Search methods

We designed a four-part search strategy. First, we searched electronic bibliographic databases for published work; second, we searched the grey literature; and third, we searched for ongoing and recently completed clinical trials in the appropriate databases. Finally, researchers of included studies were contacted, and reference lists from relevant primary and review articles were followed up. As IHCAs require relatively new technology, the search time period commenced at 1990, where possible, and ran until 31 December 2003.

Selection criteria
Selection criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of IHCAs for adults and children with chronic disease.

Data collection and analysis
Data collection and analysis

One review author screened abstracts for relevance. Two review authors screened all candidate studies to determine eligibility, apply quality criteria, and extract data from included studies. Authors of included RCTs were contacted for missing data. Results of RCTs were pooled using random-effects model with standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuous outcomes and odds ratios for binary outcomes; heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic.

Main results
Main results

We identified 24 RCTs involving 3739 participants which were included in the review.
IHCAs had a significant positive effect on knowledge (SMD 0.46; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 0.69), social support (SMD 0.35; 95\% CI 0.18 to 0.52) and clinical outcomes (SMD 0.18; 95\% CI 0.01 to 0.35). Results suggest it is more likely than not that IHCAs have a positive effect on self-efficacy (a person's belief in their capacity to carry out a specific action) (SMD 0.24; 95\% CI 0.00 to 0.48). IHCAs had a significant positive effect on continuous behavioural outcomes (SMD 0.20; 95\% CI 0.01 to 0.40). Binary behavioural outcomes also showed a positive effect for IHCAs, although this result was not statistically significant (OR 1.66; 95\% CI 0.71 to 3.87). It was not possible to determine the effects of IHCAs on emotional or economic outcomes.

Authors' conclusions
Authors' conclusions

IHCAs appear to have largely positive effects on users, in that users tend to become more knowledgeable, feel better socially supported, and may have improved behavioural and clinical outcomes compared to non-users. There is a need for more high quality studies with large sample sizes to confirm these preliminary findings, to determine the best type and best way to deliver IHCAs, and to establish how IHCAs have their effects for different groups of people with chronic illness.},

We have developed methods of analysing oncologist–patient communication and studied a variety of interventions designed to enhance communication in the cancer consultation. We have offered consultation audio-tapes to cancer patients after their initial oncology consultation and after routine outpatient follow-up appointments, and documented their use. Cancer patients and their family's value consultation audio-tapes as an information aid, and to assist recall. Consultation audio-tapes document information provision and allow analysis of oncologist–patient interaction in discussion of prognosis, treatment options and seeking/giving informed consent. Consultation audio-tapes have a role in providing feedback concerning oncologist performance. Oncologists should consider installing audio-tape-recording facilities and offer new and follow-up patients a taped consultation. Audio-tapes are a valuable tool in the investigation of oncologist–patient interactions.},

	abstract = {Background
The preliminary results of a study are usually presented as an abstract in conference meetings. The reporting quality of those abstracts and the relationship between their study designs and full paper publication rate is unknown. We hypothesized that randomized controlled trials are more likely to be published as full papers than observational studies.

Methods
154 oral abstracts presented at the World Congress of Sports Injury Prevention 2005 Oslo and the corresponding full paper publication were identified and analysed. The main outcome measures were frequency of publication, time to publication, impact factor, CONSORT (for Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) score, STROBE (for Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) score, and minor and major inconsistencies between the abstract and the full paper publication.

Results
Overall, 76 of the 154 (49\%) presented abstracts were published as full papers in a peer-reviewed journal with an impact factor of 1.946 ± 0.812. No significant difference existed between the impact factor for randomized controlled trials (2.122 ± 1.015) and observational studies (1.913 ± 0.765, p = 0.469). The full papers for the randomized controlled trials were published after an average (SD) of 17 months (± 13 months); for observational studies, the average (SD) was 12 months (± 14 months) (p = 0.323). A trend was observed in this study that a higher percentage of randomized controlled trial abstracts were published as full papers (71\% vs. 47\%, p = 0.078) than observational trials. The reporting quality of abstracts, published as full papers, significantly increased compared to conference abstracts both in randomized control studies (CONSORT: 5.7 ± 0.7 to 7.2 ± 1.3; p = 0.018, CI -2.7 to -0.32) and in observational studies (STROBE: 8.2 ± 1.3 to 8.6 ± 1.4; p = 0.007, CI -0.63 to -0.10). All of the published abstracts had at least one minor inconsistency (title, authors, research center, outcome presentation, conclusion), while 65\% had at least major inconsistencies (study objective, hypothesis, study design, primary outcome measures, sample size, statistical analysis, results, SD/CI). Comparing the results of conference and full paper; results changed in 90\% vs. 68\% (randomized, controlled studies versus observational studies); data were added (full paper reported more result data) in 60\% vs. 30\%, and deleted (full paper reported fewer result data) in 40\% vs. 30\%.

Conclusions
No significant differences with respect to type of study (randomized controlled versus observational), impact factor, and time to publication existed for the likelihood that a World Congress of Sports Injury conference abstract could be published as a full paper.},

	abstract = {To evaluate the quality of reporting in the neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nvAMD) literature by applying the Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials (CONSORT) and Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement writing standards. CONSORT and STROBE impact analysis; literature review. Phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of verteporfin photodynamic therapy, pegaptanib, and ranibizumab, and interventional case studies of bevacizumab for nvAMD. A literature search identified eligible articles published before October 31, 2007. We assessed the report quality of Phase III RCTs using the CONSORT statement and case series publications using the STROBE statement, both with indicators relevant to nvAMD. Presence or absence of CONSORT or STROBE statement indicators. Seven publications of Phase III RCTs and 29 publications on bevacizumab interventional case studies for nvAMD met our inclusion criteria. Of 37 possible CONSORT writing guideline items, the mean report quality for RCTs was 30.6 (83\%), with a range from 23 to 35 (65\%–95\%). Of 35 possible STROBE writing guideline items, the mean report quality grade for intravitreal bevacizumab case series was 23 (70\%), with a range from 16 to 31 (46\%–94\%). Among the bevacizumab studies, more than 90\% reported scientific background, drug dose and administration, baseline characteristics, unadjusted results, and adverse events. Fewer than 20\% reported study size calculations, handling of missing data, or a discussion of bias. Since the adoption of the CONSORT standards by Ophthalmology and other journals in 1996, the reporting quality for RCTs has further improved among this cohort of nvAMD articles. On the other hand, no reporting standards for case series have existed until the recent publication of the STROBE statement. In this first application of the STROBE standards to ophthalmology, we found that the small interventional studies in our series had an average reporting score lower than the RCTs, but also that some individual scores were higher than the RCTs. This outcome demonstrates that good, useful articles can be written about small studies. Although not a direct measure of the quality of a study, good reporting allows a reader to assess the validity and applicability of the study's findings.

Most studies looked at cancer and cardiovascular disease, even after we excluded specialty journals. Quantitative exposure variables predominated, which were mostly analysed as ordered categories but with little consistency or explanation regarding choice of categories. Sample selection, participant refusal, and data quality received insufficient attention in many articles. Statistical analyses commonly used odds ratios (38 articles) and hazard/rate ratios (23), with some inconsistent use of terminology. Confidence intervals were reported in most studies (68), though use of P values was less common (38). Few articles explained their choice of confounding variables; many performed subgroup analyses claiming an effect modifier, though interaction tests were rare. Several investigated multiple associations between exposure and outcome, increasing the likelihood of false positive claims. There was evidence of publication bias., Conclusions This survey raises concerns regarding inadequacies in the analysis and reporting of epidemiological publications in mainstream journals.},

Methods: The study protocol has been published at DOI: 10.1007/s11192-016-1964-8. Design: Observational cohort study. Population: Articles describing research in the life sciences published in Nature journals, submitted after May 1st 2013. Intervention: Mandatory completion of a checklist at the point of manuscript revision. Comparators: (1) Articles describing research in the life sciences published in Nature journals, submitted before May 2013; (2) Similar articles in other journals matched for date and topic. Primary Outcome: Change in proportion of Nature publications describing in vivo research published before and after May 2013 reporting the Landis 4 items (randomisation, blinding, sample size calculation, exclusions). We included 448 NPG papers (223 published before May 2013, 225 after) identified by an individual hired by NPG for this specific task, working to a standard procedure; and an independent investigator used Pubmed Related Citations to identify 448 non-NPG papers with a similar topic and date of publication in other journals; and then redacted all publications for time sensitive information and journal name. Redacted manuscripts were assessed by 2 trained reviewers against a 74 item checklist, with discrepancies resolved by a third. Results: 394 NPG and 353 matching non-NPG publications described in vivo research. The number of NPG publications meeting all relevant Landis 4 criteria increased from 0/203 prior to May 2013 to 31/181 (16.4\%) after (2-sample test for equality of proportions without continuity correction, chi-squared = 36.2, df = 1, p = 1.8 x 10-9). There was no change in the proportion of non- NPG publications meeting all relevant Landis 4 criteria (1/164 before, 1/189 after). There were more substantial improvements in the individual prevalences of reporting of randomisation, blinding, exclusions and sample size calculations for in vivo experiments, and less substantial improvements for in vitro experiments. Conclusions: There was a substantial improvement in the reporting of risks of bias in in vivo research in NPG journals following a change in editorial policy, to a level that to our knowledge has not been previously observed. However, there remain opportunities for further improvement.},

	abstract = {Objective
During the past two decades teams of researchers and editors have developed a variety of publishing guidelines to improve the quality of published research reports. Journals and editorial groups have adopted many of these guidelines. Whereas some guidelines are widely used, others have yet to be generally applied, thwarting attainment of consistent reporting among published research reports. The aim of this study is to describe the development and adoption of general publication guidelines for various study designs, provide examples of guidelines adapted for specific topics, and recommend next steps.
Study Design and Setting
We reviewed generic guidelines for reporting research results and surveyed their use in PubMed and Science Citation Index.
Results
Existing guidelines cover a broad spectrum of research designs, but there are still gaps in topics and use. Appropriate next steps include increasing use of available guidelines and their adoption among journals, educating peer reviewers on their use, and incorporating guideline use into the curriculum of medical, nursing, and public health schools.
Conclusion
Wider adoption of existing guidelines should result in research that is increasingly reported in a standardized, consistent manner.},

One of the central goals in any scientific endeavor is to understand causality. Experiments that seek to demonstrate a cause/effect relation most often manipulate the postulated causal factor. Aarts et al. describe the replication of 100 experiments reported in papers published in 2008 in three high-ranking psychology journals. Assessing whether the replication and the original experiment yielded the same result according to several criteria, they find that about one-third to one-half of the original findings were also observed in the replication study.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONReproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error.
RATIONALEThere is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science.
RESULTSWe conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (Mr = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (Mr = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (P {\textless} .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.
CONCLUSIONNo single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original P value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here.Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that “we already know this” belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/349/6251/aac4716/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Original study effect size versus replication effect size (correlation coefficients).Diagonal line represents replication effect size equal to original effect size.

The 2006 Consensus Statement on Management of Intersex Disorders stated that a mental health component to care is integral to promote positive adaptation, yet the parameters of this element have not been described. The objective of this paper is threefold: to describe the psychosocial screening protocol adopted by the clinical centers of the DSD-Translational Research Network; to summarize psychosocial data collected at 1 of the 10 network sites; and to suggest how systematic behavioral health screenings can be employed to tailor care in DSD that results in better health and quality of life outcomes. Steps taken in developing the largely “noncategorical” screening protocol are described. These preliminary findings suggest that DSD, as one category of pediatric chronic conditions, is not associated with marked disturbances of psychosocial adaptation, either for the family or the child; however, screening frequently uncovered “risk factors” for individual families or patients that can potentially be addressed in the context of ongoing clinical care. Administration of the DSD-TRN psychosocial screening protocol was demonstrated to be feasible in the context of interdisciplinary team care and was acceptable to families on a longitudinal basis. The ultimate value of systematic screening will be demonstrated through a tailoring of psychosocial, medical and surgical services, based on this information that enhances the quality of patient and family-centered care and subsequent outcomes.},

	volume = {9},
	issn = {2046-4924},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To develop criteria for classifying databases in relation to their potential use in health technology (HT) assessment and to apply them to a list of databases of relevance in the UK. To explore the extent to which prioritized databases could pick up those HTs being assessed by the National Coordinating Centre for Health Technology Assessment (NCCHTA) and the extent to which these databases have been used in HT assessment. To explore the validation of the databases and their cost.
DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases. Key literature sources. Experienced users of routine databases.
REVIEW METHODS: A 'first principles' examination of the data necessary for each type of HT assessment was carried out, supplemented by literature searches and a historical review. The principal investigators applied the criteria to the databases. Comments of the 'keepers' of the prioritized databases were incorporated. Details of 161 topics funded by the NHS R\&D Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme were reviewed iteratively by the principal investigators. Uses of databases in HTAs were identified by literature searches, which included the title of each prioritized database as a keyword. Annual reports of databases were examined and 'keepers' queried. The validity of each database was assessed using criteria based on a literature search and involvement by the authors in a national academic network. The costs of databases were established from annual reports, enquiries to 'keepers' of databases and 'guesstimates' based on cost per record. For assessing effectiveness, equity and diffusion, routine databases were classified into three broad groups: (1) group I databases, identifying both HTs and health states, (2) group II databases, identifying the HTs, but not a health state, and (3) group III databases, identifying health states, but not an HT. Group I datasets were disaggregated into clinical registries, clinical administrative databases and population-oriented databases. Group III were disaggregated into adverse event reporting, confidential enquiries, disease-only registers and health surveys.
RESULTS: Databases in group I can be used not only to assess effectiveness but also to assess diffusion and equity. Databases in group II can only assess diffusion. Group III has restricted scope for assessing HTs, except for analysis of adverse events. For use in costing, databases need to include unit costs or prices. Some databases included unit cost as well as a specific HT. A list of around 270 databases was identified at the level of UK, England and Wales or England (over 1000 including Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland). Allocation of these to the above groups identified around 60 databases with some potential for HT assessment, roughly half to group I. Eighteen clinical registers were identified as having the greatest potential although the clinical administrative datasets had potential mainly owing to their inclusion of a wide range of technologies. Only two databases were identified that could directly be used in costing. The review of the potential capture of HTs prioritized by the UK's NHS R\&D HTA programme showed that only 10\% would be captured in these databases, mainly drugs prescribed in primary care. The review of the use of routine databases in any form of HT assessment indicated that clinical registers were mainly used for national comparative audit. Some databases have only been used in annual reports, usually time trend analysis. A few peer-reviewed papers used a clinical register to assess the effectiveness of a technology. Accessibility is suggested as a barrier to using most databases. Clinical administrative databases (group Ib) have mainly been used to build population needs indices and performance indicators. A review of the validity of used databases showed that although internal consistency checks were common, relatively few had any form of external audit. Some comparative audit databases have data scrutinised by participating units. Issues around coverage and coding have, in general, received little attention. NHS funding of databases has been mainly for 'Central Returns' for management purposes, which excludes those databases with the greatest potential for HT assessment. Funding for databases was various, but some are unfunded, relying on goodwill. The estimated total cost of databases in group I plus selected databases from groups II and III has been estimated at pound 50 million or around 0.1\% of annual NHS spend. A few databases with limited potential for HT assessment account for the bulk of spending.
CONCLUSIONS: Suggestions for policy include clarification of responsibility for the strategic development of databases, improved resourcing, and issues around coding, confidentiality, ownership and access, maintenance of clinical support, optimal use of information technology, filling gaps and remedying deficiencies. Recommendations for researchers include closer policy links between routine data and R\&D, and selective investment in the more promising databases. Recommended research topics include optimal capture and coding of the range of HTs, international comparisons of the role, funding and use of routine data in healthcare systems and use of routine database in trials and in modelling. Independent evaluations are recommended for information strategies (such as those around the National Service Frameworks and various collaborations) and for electronic patient and health records.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Personality influences decision making and ethical considerations. Its influence on the occurrence of research misbehavior has never been studied. This study aims to determine the association between personality traits and self-reported questionable research practices and research misconduct. We hypothesized that narcissistic, Machiavellianistic and psychopathic traits as well as self-esteem are associated with research misbehavior.
METHODS: Included in this cross-sectional study design were 535 Dutch biomedical scientists (response rate 65\%) from all hierarchical layers of 4 university medical centers in the Netherlands. We used validated personality questionnaires such as the Dark Triad (narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism), Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale, the Publication Pressure Questionnaire (PPQ), and also demographic and job-specific characteristics to investigate the association of personality traits with a composite research misbehavior severity score.
FINDINGS: Machiavellianism was positively associated (beta 1.28, CI 1.06-1.53) with self-reported research misbehavior, while narcissism, psychopathy and self-esteem were not. Exploratory analysis revealed that narcissism and research misconduct were more severe among persons in higher academic ranks (i.e., professors) (p{\textless}0.01 and p{\textless}0.001, respectively), and self-esteem scores and publication pressure were lower (p{\textless}0.001 and p{\textless}0.01, respectively) as compared to postgraduate PhD fellows.
CONCLUSIONS: Machiavellianism may be a risk factor for research misbehaviour. Narcissism and research misbehaviour were more prevalent among biomedical scientists in higher academic positions. These results suggest that personality has an impact on research behavior and should be taken into account in fostering responsible conduct of research.},

	abstract = {Background
Observational studies are the most frequently published studies in literature. When randomized controlled trials cannot be conducted because of ethical or practical considerations, an observational study design is the first choice. The STROBE Statement (STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology) was developed to provide guidance on how to adequately report observational studies.

Objectives
The objectives were 1) to evaluate the quality of reporting of observational studies of otorhinolaryngologic literature using the STROBE Statement checklist, 2) to compare the quality of reporting of observational studies in the top 5 Ear, Nose, Throat (ENT) journals versus the top 5 general medical journals and 3) to formulate recommendations to improve adequate reporting of observational research in otorhinolaryngologic literature.

Methods
The top 5 general medical journals and top 5 otorhinolaryngologic journals were selected based on their ISI Web of Knowledge impact factors. On August 3rd, 2015, we performed a PubMed search using different filters to retrieve observational articles from these journals. Studies were selected from 2010 to 2014 for the general medical journals and from 2015 for the ENT journals. We assessed all STROBE items to examine how many items were reported adequately for each journal type.

Results
The articles in the top 5 general medical journals (n = 11) reported a mean of 69.2\% (95\% confidence interval (CI): 65.8\%–72.7\%; median 70.6\%), whereas the top 5 ENT journals (n = 29) reported a mean of 51.4\% (95\% CI: 47.7\%–55.0\%; median 50.0\%). The two journal types reported STROBE items significantly different (p {\textless} .001).

Conclusion
Quality of reporting of observational studies in otorhinolaryngologic articles can considerably enhance. The quality of reporting was better in general medical journals compared to ENT journals. To improve the quality of reporting of observational studies, we recommend authors and editors to endorse and actively implement the STROBE Statement.},

	abstract = {Objectives
To assess reporting quality of studies using routinely collected health data (RCD) to inform the REporting of studies Conducted using Observational Routinely collected health Data (RECORD) guideline development.

Study Design and Setting
PubMed search for observational studies using RCD on any epidemiologic or clinical topic. Sample of studies published in 2012. Evaluation of five items based on the STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guideline and eight newly developed items for RCD studies.

Results
Of 124 included studies, 39 (31.5\%) clearly described its design in title or abstract. Complete information to frame a focused research question, that is, on the population, intervention/exposure, and outcome, was provided for 51 studies (41.1\%). In 44 studies where definitions of codes or classification algorithms would be necessary to operationalize such a research question, only nine (20.5\%) reported all items adequately. In 81 studies describing multivariable analyses, 54 (66.7\%) reported all variables used for modeling and 34 (42.0\%) reported basic details required for replication. Database linkage was reported adequately in 12 of 41 studies (29.3\%). Statements about data sharing/availability were rare (5/124; 4\%).

Conclusion
Most RCD studies are insufficiently reported. Specific reporting guidelines and more awareness and education on their use are urgently needed.},

	abstract = {Objective To assess whether the completeness of reporting of health research is related to journals’ endorsement of reporting guidelines.
Design Systematic review.
Data sources Reporting guidelines from a published systematic review and the EQUATOR Network (October 2011). Studies assessing the completeness of reporting by using an included reporting guideline (termed “evaluations”) (1990 to October 2011; addendum searches in January 2012) from searches of either Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Methodology Register or Scopus, depending on reporting guideline name.
Study selection English language reporting guidelines that provided explicit guidance for reporting, described the guidance development process, and indicated use of a consensus development process were included. The CONSORT statement was excluded, as evaluations of adherence to CONSORT had previously been reviewed. English or French language evaluations of included reporting guidelines were eligible if they assessed the completeness of reporting of studies as a primary intent and those included studies enabled the comparisons of interest (that is, after versus before journal endorsement and/or endorsing versus non-endorsing journals).
Data extraction Potentially eligible evaluations of included guidelines were screened initially by title and abstract and then as full text reports. If eligibility was unclear, authors of evaluations were contacted; journals’ websites were consulted for endorsement information where needed. The completeness of reporting of reporting guidelines was analyzed in relation to endorsement by item and, where consistent with the authors’ analysis, a mean summed score.
Results 101 reporting guidelines were included. Of 15 249 records retrieved from the search for evaluations, 26 evaluations that assessed completeness of reporting in relation to endorsement for nine reporting guidelines were identified. Of those, 13 evaluations assessing seven reporting guidelines (BMJ economic checklist, CONSORT for harms, PRISMA, QUOROM, STARD, STRICTA, and STROBE) could be analyzed. Reporting guideline items were assessed by few evaluations.
Conclusions The completeness of reporting of only nine of 101 health research reporting guidelines (excluding CONSORT) has been evaluated in relation to journals’ endorsement. Items from seven reporting guidelines were quantitatively analyzed, by few evaluations each. Insufficient evidence exists to determine the relation between journals’ endorsement of reporting guidelines and the completeness of reporting of published health research reports. Journal editors and researchers should consider collaborative prospectively designed, controlled studies to provide more robust evidence.

	abstract = {Background
The STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement was published in October 2007 to improve quality of reporting of observational studies. The aim of this review was to assess the impact of the STROBE statement on observational study reporting and study design quality in the nephrology literature.

Study Design
Systematic literature review.

Setting \& Population
European and North American, Pre-dialysis Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) cohort studies.

Selection Criteria for Studies
Studies assessing the association between CKD and mortality in the elderly ({\textgreater}65 years) published from 1st January 2002 to 31st December 2013 were included, following systematic searching of MEDLINE \& EMBASE.

Predictor
Time period before and after the publication of the STROBE statement.

Outcome
Quality of study reporting using the STROBE statement and quality of study design using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS), Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) and Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) tools.

Results
37 papers (11 Pre \& 26 Post STROBE) were identified from 3621 potential articles. Only four of the 22 STROBE items and their sub-criteria (objectives reporting, choice of quantitative groups and description of and carrying out sensitivity analysis) showed improvements, with the majority of items showing little change between the period before and after publication of the STROBE statement. Pre- and post-period analysis revealed a Manuscript STROBE score increase (median score 77.8\% (Inter-quartile range [IQR], 64.7–82.0) vs 83\% (IQR, 78.4–84.9, p = 0.05). There was no change in quality of study design with identical median scores in the two periods for NOS (Manuscript NOS score 88.9), SIGN (Manuscript SIGN score 83.3) and CASP (Manuscript CASP score 91.7) tools.

Limitations
Only 37 Studies from Europe and North America were included from one medical specialty. Assessment of study design largely reliant on good reporting.

Conclusions
This study highlights continuing deficiencies in the reporting of STROBE items and their sub-criteria in cohort studies in nephrology. There was weak evidence of improvement in the overall reporting quality, with no improvement in methodological quality of CKD cohort studies between the period before and after publication of the STROBE statement.},

METHODS: All cohort, cross-sectional, and case-control studies published in five major plastic surgery journals in 2013 were assessed for their compliance with the STROBE statement.
RESULTS: One hundred thirty-six studies were identified initially and 94 met the inclusion criteria. The average STROBE score was 12.4 (range, 2-20.1) with a standard deviation of 3.36. The most frequent reporting deficiencies were not reporting the study design in the title and abstract 30\% compliance; describing the setting, locations, and relevant dates, including periods of recruitment, exposure, follow-up, and data collection (24\%); describing efforts to address sources of bias (20\%); reporting numbers of individuals at each stage of the study (20\%); and discussing limitations (40\%).
CONCLUSIONS: The reporting quality of observational studies in Plastic Surgery needs improvement. We suggest ways this could be improved including better education, awareness among all stakeholders, and hardwiring compliance through electronic journal submission systems.},

The poor reporting and use of statistical methods in orthopaedic papers has been widely discussed by both clinicians and statisticians. A detailed review of research published in general orthopaedic journals was undertaken to assess the quality of experimental design, statistical analysis and reporting. A representative sample of 100 papers was assessed for compliance to CONSORT and STROBE guidelines and the quality of the statistical reporting was assessed using a validated questionnaire. Overall compliance with CONSORT and STROBE guidelines in our study was 59\% and 58\% respectively, with very few papers fulfilling all criteria. In 37\% of papers patient numbers were inadequately reported; 20\% of papers introduced new statistical methods in the ‘results’ section not previously reported in the ‘methods’ section, and 23\% of papers reported no measurement of error with the main outcome measure. Taken together, these issues indicate a general lack of statistical rigour and are consistent with similar reviews undertaken in a number of other scientific and clinical research disciplines. It is imperative that the orthopaedic research community strives to improve the quality of reporting; a failure to do so could seriously limit the development of future research.},

Cohort, case-control and other observational studies regularly contribute key aetiological, clinical and public health knowledge, and most research papers published in medical journals describe observational studies.1 Sexually transmitted infections are no exception. For example, in the early 1980s, before the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was discovered, a case-control study identified a higher number of sexual partners as a risk factor for Kaposi sarcoma in men who have sex with men.2 Later, a cohort study of female sex workers in Kinshasa showed that gonorrhoea and genital Chlamydia infection were strongly associated with HIV-1 transmission.3 A possible protective effect of male circumcision on the risk of HIV infection was first suggested in 1986, based on biological reasoning.4 Over subsequent years, the association between male circumcision and HIV infection was examined in a large number of observational studies, including ecological, cross-sectional, case-control and cohort studies, which taken together showed a substantial reduction in risk, similar to that observed in the recent randomised trials.5

The reputation of observational epidemiology is nevertheless mixed: it is not uncommon for observational research to produce contradictory, or even spurious, findings.6 7 Conflicting results from epidemiological studies, often of exposures related to diet or other life style factors, provide a constant source of anxiety for the public.8 The credibility of observational study (and any other research) depends on its …},

Additionally, the relationship between study methods and effect size (ES) in HPE research is unknown. Objectives  This review aimed to evaluate, in a sample of experimental studies of Internet-based instruction, the quality of reporting, the relationship between reporting and methodological quality, and associations between ES and study methods. Methods  We conducted a systematic search of databases including MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL, EMBASE and ERIC, for articles published during 1990–2008. Studies (in any language) quantifying the effect of Internet-based instruction in HPE compared with no intervention or other instruction were included. Working independently and in duplicate, we coded reporting quality using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement, and coded study methods using a modified Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (m-NOS), the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI), and the Best Evidence in Medical Education (BEME) global scale. Results  For reporting quality, articles scored a mean ± standard deviation (SD) of 51 ± 25\% of STROBE elements for the Introduction, 58 ± 20\% for the Methods, 50 ± 18\% for the Results and 41 ± 26\% for the Discussion sections. We found positive associations (all p {\textless} 0.0001) between reporting quality and MERSQI (ρ = 0.64), m-NOS (ρ = 0.57) and BEME (ρ = 0.58) scores. We explored associations between study methods and knowledge ES by subtracting each study’s ES from the pooled ES for studies using that method and comparing these differences between subgroups. Effect sizes in single-group pretest/post-test studies differed from the pooled estimate more than ESs in two-group studies (p = 0.013). No difference was found between other study methods (yes/no: representative sample, comparison group from same community, randomised, allocation concealed, participants blinded, assessor blinded, objective assessment, high follow-up). Conclusions  Information is missing from all sections of reports of HPE experiments. Single-group pre-/post-test studies may overestimate ES compared with two-group designs. Other methodological variations did not bias study results in this sample.},

	abstract = {An overwhelming body of evidence stating that the completeness of reporting of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is not optimal has accrued over time. In the mid-1990s, in response to these concerns, an international group of clinical trialists, statisticians, epidemiologists, and biomedical journal editors developed the CONsolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statement. The CONSORT Statement, most recently updated in March 2010, is an evidence-based minimum set of recommendations including a checklist and flow diagram for reporting RCTs and is intended to facilitate the complete and transparent reporting of trials and aid their critical appraisal and interpretation. In 2006, a systematic review of eight studies evaluating the "effectiveness of CONSORT in improving reporting quality in journals" was published.

Objectives
Objectives

To update the earlier systematic review assessing whether journal endorsement of the 1996 and 2001 CONSORT checklists influences the completeness of reporting of RCTs published in medical journals.

Search methods
Search methods

We conducted electronic searches, known item searching, and reference list scans to identify reports of evaluations assessing the completeness of reporting of RCTs. The electronic search strategy was developed in MEDLINE and tailored to EMBASE. We searched the Cochrane Methodology Register and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews using the Wiley interface. We searched the Science Citation Index, Social Science Citation Index, and Arts and Humanities Citation Index through the ISI Web of Knowledge interface. We conducted all searches to identify reports published between January 2005 and March 2010, inclusive.

Selection criteria
Selection criteria

In addition to studies identified in the original systematic review on this topic, comparative studies evaluating the completeness of reporting of RCTs in any of the following comparison groups were eligible for inclusion in this review: 1) Completeness of reporting of RCTs published in journals that have and have not endorsed the CONSORT Statement; 2) Completeness of reporting of RCTs published in CONSORT-endorsing journals before and after endorsement; or 3) Completeness of reporting of RCTs before and after the publication of the CONSORT Statement (1996 or 2001). We used a broad definition of CONSORT endorsement that includes any of the following: (a) requirement or recommendation in journal's 'Instructions to Authors' to follow CONSORT guidelines; (b) journal editorial statement endorsing the CONSORT Statement; or (c) editorial requirement for authors to submit a CONSORT checklist and/or flow diagram with their manuscript. We contacted authors of evaluations reporting data that could be included in any comparison group(s), but not presented as such in the published report and asked them to provide additional data in order to determine eligibility of their evaluation. Evaluations were not excluded due to language of publication or validity assessment.

Data collection and analysis
Data collection and analysis

We completed screening and data extraction using standardised electronic forms, where conflicts, reasons for exclusion, and level of agreement were all automatically and centrally managed in web-based management software, DistillerSR®. One of two authors extracted general characteristics of included evaluations and all data were verified by a second author. Data describing completeness of reporting were extracted by one author using a pre-specified form; a 10\% random sample of evaluations was verified by a second author. Any discrepancies were discussed by both authors; we made no modifications to the extracted data. Validity assessments of included evaluations were conducted by one author and independently verified by one of three authors. We resolved all conflicts by consensus.
For each comparison we collected data on 27 outcomes: 22 items of the CONSORT 2001 checklist, plus four items relating to the reporting of blinding, and one item of aggregate CONSORT scores. Where reported, we extracted and qualitatively synthesised data on the methodological quality of RCTs, by scale or score.

Main results
Main results

Fifty-three publications reporting 50 evaluations were included. The total number of RCTs assessed within evaluations was 16,604 (median per evaluation 123 (interquartile range (IQR) 77 to 226) published in a median of six (IQR 3 to 26) journals. Characteristics of the included RCT populations were variable, resulting in heterogeneity between included evaluations. Validity assessments of included studies resulted in largely unclear judgements. The included evaluations are not RCTs and less than 8\% (4/53) of the evaluations reported adjusting for potential confounding factors.
Twenty-five of 27 outcomes assessing completeness of reporting in RCTs appeared to favour CONSORT-endorsing journals over non-endorsers, of which five were statistically significant. 'Allocation concealment' resulted in the largest effect, with risk ratio (RR) 1.81 (99\% confidence interval (CI) 1.25 to 2.61), suggesting that 81\% more RCTs published in CONSORT-endorsing journals adequately describe allocation concealment compared to those published in non-endorsing journals. Allocation concealment was reported adequately in 45\% (393/876) of RCTs in CONSORT-endorsing journals and in 22\% (329/1520) of RCTs in non-endorsing journals. Other outcomes with results that were significant include: scientific rationale and background in the 'Introduction' (RR 1.07, 99\% CI 1.01 to 1.14); 'sample size' (RR 1.61, 99\% CI 1.13 to 2.29); method used for 'sequence generation' (RR 1.59, 99\% CI 1.38 to 1.84); and an aggregate score over reported CONSORT items, 'total sum score' (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.68 (99\% CI 0.38 to 0.98)).

Authors' conclusions
Authors' conclusions

Evidence has accumulated to suggest that the reporting of RCTs remains sub-optimal. This review updates a previous systematic review of eight evaluations. The findings of this review are similar to those from the original review and demonstrate that, despite the general inadequacies of reporting of RCTs, journal endorsement of the CONSORT Statement may beneficially influence the completeness of reporting of trials published in medical journals. Future prospective studies are needed to explore the influence of the CONSORT Statement dependent on the extent of editorial policies to ensure adherence to CONSORT guidance.},

	abstract = {Objective
Interrupted time series is a strong quasi-experimental research design that is increasingly applied to estimate the effects of health services and policy interventions. We describe and illustrate two methods for estimating confidence intervals around absolute and relative changes in outcomes calculated from segmented regression parameter estimates.

Study Design and Setting
We used multivariate delta and bootstrapping methods to construct confidence intervals around relative changes in level and trend and around absolute changes in outcome based on segmented linear regression analyses of time series data corrected for auto-correlated errors.

Results
Using previously published time series data, we estimated confidence intervals around the effect of prescription alerts for interacting medications with warfarin on the rate of prescriptions per 10,000 warfarin users per month. Both the multivariate delta method and the bootstrapping method produced similar results.

Conclusion
The bootstrapping method is preferred for calculating confidence intervals of relative changes in outcomes of time series studies since it does not require large sample sizes when parameter estimates are obtained correctly from the model. Caution is needed when sample size is small.},

	abstract = {The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement was developed to improve the reporting of randomised controlled trials. It was initially published in 1996 and focused on the reporting of parallel group randomised controlled trials. The statement was revised in 2001, with a further update in 2010. A separate CONSORT statement for the reporting of abstracts was published in 2008. In earlier papers we considered the implications of the 2001 version of the CONSORT statement for the reporting of cluster randomised trial. In this paper we provide updated and extended guidance, based on the 2010 version of the CONSORT statement and the 2008 CONSORT statement for the reporting of abstracts.

Many journals now require that reports of trials conform to the guidelines in the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement, first published in 1996,1 revised in 2001,2 and revised most recently in 2010.3 The statement includes a checklist of items that should be included in the trial report. These items are evidence based whenever possible and are regularly reviewed.4 The statement also recommends including a flow diagram to show the progression of participants from group assignment through to the final analysis. An explanation and elaboration of the rationale for the checklist items is provided in an accompanying article.4

The standard CONSORT statement focuses on reporting parallel group randomised controlled trials in which individual participants are randomly assigned to study groups. However, in some situations it is preferable to randomly assign groups of people (such as communities, families, or medical practices) rather than individuals. Reasons include the threat of “contamination” (the unintentional spill-over of intervention effects from one treatment group to another) of some interventions if individual randomisation is used.5 6 Also, in certain settings, randomisation by group may be the only feasible method …},

In the absence of direct comparative evidence, a network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted to provide an indirect assessment of the relative efficacy, safety, and tolerability of PEG-IFN versus other injectable RRMS therapies. Systematic searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, and conference proceedings from relevant annual symposia were hand-searched. Included studies were randomized controlled trials evaluating ≥1 first-line treatments including interferon beta-1a 30, 44, and 22 μg, interferon beta-1b, and glatiramer acetate in patients with RRMS. Studies were included based on a pre-specified protocol and extracted by a team of independent reviewers and information scientists, utilizing criteria from NICE and IQWiG. In line with ADVANCE findings, NMA results support that PEG-IFN every 2 weeks significantly reduced annualized relapse rate, and 3- and 6-month confirmed disability progression (CDP) versus placebo. There was numerical trend favoring PEG-IFN every 2 weeks versus other IFNs assessed for annualized relapse rate, and versus all other injectables for 3- and 6-month CDP (6-month CDP was significantly reduced versus IFN beta-1a 30 μg). The safety and tolerability profile of PEG-IFN beta-1a 125 μg every 2 weeks was consistent with that of other evaluated treatments. Study limitations for the NMA include variant definitions of relapse and other systematic differences across trials, assumptions that populations were sufficiently similar, and inability to perform NMA of adverse events. With similar efficacy compared to other RRMS treatments in terms of annualized relapse rate and 3- and 6-month CDP, a promising safety profile, and up to 93\% reduction in number of injections (which may improve adherence), PEG-IFN every 2 weeks offers a valuable alternative treatment option for patients with RRMS.},

The two studies focus on evaluating the psychometric properties of the ease of use and usefulness scales, while examining the relationship between ease of use, usefulness, and system usage. Study 1 provides a strong assessment of the convergent validity of the two scales by examining heterogeneous user groups dealing with heterogeneous implementations of messaging technology. In addition, because one might expect users to share similar perspectives about voice and electronic mail, the study also represents a strong test of discriminant validity. In this study a total of 118 respondents from 10 different organizations were surveyed for their attitudes toward two messaging technologies: voice and electronic mail. Study 2 complements the approach taken in Study 1 by focusing on the ability to demonstrate discriminant validity. Three popular software applications (WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, and Harvard Graphics) were examined based on the expectation that they would all be rated highly on both scales. In this study a total of 73 users rated the three packages in terms of ease of use and usefulness. The results of the studies demonstrate reliable and valid scales for measurement of perceived ease of use and usefulness. In addition, the paper tests the relationships between ease of use, usefulness, and usage using structural equation modelling. The results of this model are consistent with previous research for Study 1, suggesting that usefulness is an important determinant of system use. For Study 2 the results are somewhat mixed, but indicate the importance of both ease of use and usefulness. Differences in conditions of usage are explored to explain these findings.},

We recognize that achieving a meaningful improvement in the quality of reporting will require a concerted effort by investigators, reviewers, funding agencies and journal editors.

\#\#\#\# Summary points

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the ideal approach for assessing the effectiveness of interventions. However, not all interventions can be assessed with an RCT, whereas for many interventions trials can be prohibitively expensive. In addition, even well designed RCTs can be susceptible to systematic errors leading to biased estimates, particularly when generalising results to “real world” settings. For example, the external validity of clinical trials in diabetes seems to be poor; the proportion of the Scottish population that met eligibility criteria for seven major clinical trials ranged from 3.5\% to 50.7\%.1 One of the greatest concerns is patients with multimorbidity, who are commonly excluded from RCTs.2

Observational studies can address some of these shortcomings, but the lack of researcher control over confounding variables and the difficulty in establishing causation mean that conclusions from studies using observational approaches are generally considered to be weaker. However, with quasi-experimental study designs researchers are able to estimate causal effects using observational approaches. Interrupted time series (ITS) analysis is a useful quasi-experimental design with which to evaluate the longitudinal effects of interventions, through regression modelling.3 The term quasi-experimental refers to an absence of randomisation, and ITS analysis is principally a tool for analysing observational data where full randomisation, or a case-control …},

	abstract = {Summary
The increase in annual global investment in biomedical research—reaching US\$240 billion in 2010—has resulted in important health dividends for patients and the public. However, much research does not lead to worthwhile achievements, partly because some studies are done to improve understanding of basic mechanisms that might not have relevance for human health. Additionally, good research ideas often do not yield the anticipated results. As long as the way in which these ideas are prioritised for research is transparent and warranted, these disappointments should not be deemed wasteful; they are simply an inevitable feature of the way science works. However, some sources of waste cannot be justified. In this report, we discuss how avoidable waste can be considered when research priorities are set. We have four recommendations. First, ways to improve the yield from basic research should be investigated. Second, the transparency of processes by which funders prioritise important uncertainties should be increased, making clear how they take account of the needs of potential users of research. Third, investment in additional research should always be preceded by systematic assessment of existing evidence. Fourth, sources of information about research that is in progress should be strengthened and developed and used by researchers. Research funders have primary responsibility for reductions in waste resulting from decisions about what research to do.},

	abstract = {Summary
Research publication can both communicate and miscommunicate. Unless research is adequately reported, the time and resources invested in the conduct of research is wasted. Reporting guidelines such as CONSORT, STARD, PRISMA, and ARRIVE aim to improve the quality of research reports, but all are much less adopted and adhered to than they should be. Adequate reports of research should clearly describe which questions were addressed and why, what was done, what was shown, and what the findings mean. However, substantial failures occur in each of these elements. For example, studies of published trial reports showed that the poor description of interventions meant that 40–89\% were non-replicable; comparisons of protocols with publications showed that most studies had at least one primary outcome changed, introduced, or omitted; and investigators of new trials rarely set their findings in the context of a systematic review, and cited a very small and biased selection of previous relevant trials. Although best documented in reports of controlled trials, inadequate reporting occurs in all types of studies—animal and other preclinical studies, diagnostic studies, epidemiological studies, clinical prediction research, surveys, and qualitative studies. In this report, and in the Series more generally, we point to a waste at all stages in medical research. Although a more nuanced understanding of the complex systems involved in the conduct, writing, and publication of research is desirable, some immediate action can be taken to improve the reporting of research. Evidence for some recommendations is clear: change the current system of research rewards and regulations to encourage better and more complete reporting, and fund the development and maintenance of infrastructure to support better reporting, linkage, and archiving of all elements of research. However, the high amount of waste also warrants future investment in the monitoring of and research into reporting of research, and active implementation of the findings to ensure that research reports better address the needs of the range of research users.},

	abstract = {Background
PubMed translations of OvidSP Medline search filters offer searchers improved ease of access. They may also facilitate access to PubMed’s unique content, including citations for the most recently published biomedical evidence. Retrieving this content requires a search strategy comprising natural language terms (‘textwords’), rather than Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). We describe a reproducible methodology that uses a validated PubMed search filter translation to create a textword-only strategy to extend retrieval to PubMed’s unique heart failure literature.

Methods
We translated an OvidSP Medline heart failure search filter for PubMed and established version equivalence in terms of indexed literature retrieval. The PubMed version was then run within PubMed to identify citations retrieved by the filter’s MeSH terms (Heart failure, Left ventricular dysfunction, and Cardiomyopathy). It was then rerun with the same MeSH terms restricted to searching on title and abstract fields (i.e. as ‘textwords’). Citations retrieved by the MeSH search but not the textword search were isolated. Frequency analysis of their titles/abstracts identified natural language alternatives for those MeSH terms that performed less effectively as textwords. These terms were tested in combination to determine the best performing search string for reclaiming this ‘lost set’. This string, restricted to searching on PubMed’s unique content, was then combined with the validated PubMed translation to extend the filter’s performance in this database.

Results
The PubMed heart failure filter retrieved 6829 citations. Of these, 834 (12\%) failed to be retrieved when MeSH terms were converted to textwords. Frequency analysis of the 834 citations identified five high frequency natural language alternatives that could improve retrieval of this set (cardiac failure, cardiac resynchronization, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, and LV dysfunction). Together these terms reclaimed 157/834 (18.8\%) of lost citations.

Conclusions
MeSH terms facilitate precise searching in PubMed’s indexed subset. They may, however, work less effectively as search terms prior to subject indexing. A validated PubMed search filter can be used to develop a supplementary textword-only search strategy to extend retrieval to PubMed’s unique content. A PubMed heart failure search filter is available on the CareSearch website (http://www.caresearch.com.au) providing access to both indexed and non-indexed heart failure evidence.},

Most subjective measures used in practice are unvalidated, and their relationship to system usage is unknown. The present research develops and validates new scales for two specific variables, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which are hypothesized to be fundamental determinants of user acceptance. Definitions for these two variables were used to develop scale items that were pretested for content validity and then tested for reliability and construct validity in two studies involving a total of 152 users and four application programs. The measures were refined and stream-lined, resulting in two six-item scales with reliabilities of.98 for usefulness and.94 for ease of use. The scales exhibited high convergent, discriminant, and factorial validity. Perceived usefulness was significantly correlated with both self-reported current usage (r=.63, Study 1) and self-predicted future usage (r=.85, Study 2). Perceived ease of use was also significantly correlated with current usage (r=.45, Study 1) and future usage (r=.59, Study 2). In both studies, usefulness had a significantly greater correlation with usage behavior than did ease of use. Regression analyses suggest that perceived ease of use may actually be a causal antecedent to perceived usefulness, as opposed to a parallel, direct determinant of system usage. Implications are drawn for future research on user acceptance.},

	abstract = {Background
Reporting guidelines have been available for the past 17 years since the inception of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement in 1996. These guidelines were developed to improve the quality of reporting of studies in medical literature. Despite the widespread availability of these guidelines, the quality of reporting of medical literature remained suboptimal. In this study, we assess the current adherence practice to reporting guidelines; determine key factors associated with better adherence to these guidelines; and provide recommendations to enhance adherence to reporting guidelines for future studies.

Methods
We undertook a systematic scoping review of systematic reviews of adherence to reporting guidelines across different clinical areas and study designs. We searched four electronic databases (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, Embase, and Medline) from January 1996 to September 2012. Studies were included if they addressed adherence to one of the following guidelines: Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT), Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), Quality of Reporting of Meta-analysis (QUOROM), Transparent Reporting of Evaluations with Nonrandomized Designs (TREND), Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) and Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE). A protocol for this study was devised. A literature search, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed independently by two authors in duplicate. This study reporting follows the PRISMA guidelines.

Results
Our search retrieved 5159 titles, of which 50 were eligible. Overall, 86.0\% of studies reported suboptimal levels of adherence to reporting guidelines. Factors associated with better adherence included journal impact factor and endorsement of guidelines, publication date, funding source, multisite studies, pharmacological interventions and larger studies.

Conclusion
Reporting guidelines in the clinical literature are important to improve the standards of reporting of clinical studies; however, adherence to these guidelines remains suboptimal. Action is therefore needed to enhance the adherence to these standards. Strategies to enhance adherence include journal editorial policies endorsing these guidelines.},

Many national public health systems and international organizations rely on RDS data. However, RDS reporting quality and available reporting guidelines are inadequate. We carried out a systematic review of RDS studies and present Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology for RDS Studies (STROBE-RDS), a checklist of essential items to present in RDS publications, justified by an explanation and elaboration document.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We searched the MEDLINE (1970-2013), EMBASE (1974-2013), and Global Health (1910-2013) databases to assess the number and geographical distribution of published RDS studies. STROBE-RDS was developed based on STROBE guidelines, following Guidance for Developers of Health Research Reporting Guidelines.
RESULTS: RDS has been used in over 460 studies from 69 countries, including the USA (151 studies), China (70), and India (32). STROBE-RDS includes modifications to 12 of the 22 items on the STROBE checklist. The two key areas that required modification concerned the selection of participants and statistical analysis of the sample.
CONCLUSION: STROBE-RDS seeks to enhance the transparency and utility of research using RDS. If widely adopted, STROBE-RDS should improve global infectious diseases public health decision making.},

Design Retrospective before and after study.
Setting BioMed Central series medical journals.
Sample 93 primary reports of randomised trials published in BMC-series medical journals in 2012.
Main outcome measures Changes to the reporting of methodological aspects of randomised trials in manuscripts after peer review, based on the CONSORT checklist, corresponding peer reviewer reports, the type of changes requested, and the extent to which authors adhered to these requests.
Results Of the 93 trial reports, 38\% (n=35) did not describe the method of random sequence generation, 54\% (n=50) concealment of allocation sequence, 50\% (n=46) whether the study was blinded, 34\% (n=32) the sample size calculation, 35\% (n=33) specification of primary and secondary outcomes, 55\% (n=51) results for the primary outcome, and 90\% (n=84) details of the trial protocol. The number of changes between manuscript versions was relatively small; most involved adding new information or altering existing information. Most changes requested by peer reviewers had a positive impact on the reporting of the final manuscript—for example, adding or clarifying randomisation and blinding (n=27), sample size (n=15), primary and secondary outcomes (n=16), results for primary or secondary outcomes (n=14), and toning down conclusions to reflect the results (n=27). Some changes requested by peer reviewers, however, had a negative impact, such as adding additional unplanned analyses (n=15).
Conclusion Peer reviewers fail to detect important deficiencies in reporting of the methods and results of randomised trials. The number of these changes requested by peer reviewers was relatively small. Although most had a positive impact, some were inappropriate and could have a negative impact on reporting in the final publication.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Previous studies indicate that the interpretation of trial results can be distorted by authors of published reports.
OBJECTIVE: To identify the nature and frequency of distorted presentation or "spin" (ie, specific reporting strategies, whatever their motive, to highlight that the experimental treatment is beneficial, despite a statistically nonsignificant difference for the primary outcome, or to distract the reader from statistically nonsignificant results) in published reports of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with statistically nonsignificant results for primary outcomes.
DATA SOURCES: March 2007 search of MEDLINE via PubMed using the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy to identify reports of RCTs published in December 2006.
STUDY SELECTION: Articles were included if they were parallel-group RCTs with a clearly identified primary outcome showing statistically nonsignificant results (ie, P {\textgreater} or = .05).
DATA EXTRACTION: Two readers appraised each selected article using a pretested, standardized data abstraction form developed in a pilot test.
RESULTS: From the 616 published reports of RCTs examined, 72 were eligible and appraised. The title was reported with spin in 13 articles (18.0\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 10.0\%-28.9\%). Spin was identified in the Results and Conclusions sections of the abstracts of 27 (37.5\%; 95\% CI, 26.4\%-49.7\%) and 42 (58.3\%; 95\% CI, 46.1\%-69.8\%) reports, respectively, with the conclusions of 17 (23.6\%; 95\% CI, 14.4\%-35.1\%) focusing only on treatment effectiveness. Spin was identified in the main-text Results, Discussion, and Conclusions sections of 21 (29.2\%; 95\% CI, 19.0\%-41.1\%), 31 (43.1\%; 95\% CI, 31.4\%-55.3\%), and 36 (50.0\%; 95\% CI, 38.0\%-62.0\%) reports, respectively. More than 40\% of the reports had spin in at least 2 of these sections in the main text.
CONCLUSION: In this representative sample of RCTs published in 2006 with statistically nonsignificant primary outcomes, the reporting and interpretation of findings was frequently inconsistent with the results.},

	abstract = {Background
The peer review process is a cornerstone of biomedical research. We aimed to evaluate the impact of interventions to improve the quality of peer review for biomedical publications.

Methods
We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and WHO ICTRP databases, for all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the impact of interventions to improve the quality of peer review for biomedical publications. 

Results
We selected 22 reports of randomized controlled trials, for 25 comparisons evaluating training interventions (n = 5), the addition of a statistical peer reviewer (n = 2), use of a checklist (n = 2), open peer review (i.e., peer reviewers informed that their identity would be revealed; n = 7), blinded peer review (i.e., peer reviewers blinded to author names and affiliation; n = 6) and other interventions to increase the speed of the peer review process (n = 3). Results from only seven RCTs were published since 2004. As compared with the standard peer review process, training did not improve the quality of the peer review report and use of a checklist did not improve the quality of the final manuscript. Adding a statistical peer review improved the quality of the final manuscript (standardized mean difference (SMD), 0.58; 95 \% CI, 0.19 to 0.98). Open peer review improved the quality of the peer review report (SMD, 0.14; 95 \% CI, 0.05 to 0.24), did not affect the time peer reviewers spent on the peer review (mean difference, 0.18; 95 \% CI, –0.06 to 0.43), and decreased the rate of rejection (odds ratio, 0.56; 95 \% CI, 0.33 to 0.94). Blinded peer review did not affect the quality of the peer review report or rejection rate. Interventions to increase the speed of the peer review process were too heterogeneous to allow for pooling the results.

Conclusion
Despite the essential role of peer review, only a few interventions have been assessed in randomized controlled trials. Evidence-based peer review needs to be developed in biomedical journals.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although peer review is widely considered to be the most credible way of selecting manuscripts and improving the quality of accepted papers in scientific journals, there is little evidence to support its use. Our aim was to estimate the effects on manuscript quality of either adding a statistical peer reviewer or suggesting the use of checklists such as CONSORT or STARD to clinical reviewers or both.
METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Interventions were defined as 1) the addition of a statistical reviewer to the clinical peer review process, and 2) suggesting reporting guidelines to reviewers; with "no statistical expert" and "no checklist" as controls. The two interventions were crossed in a 2x2 balanced factorial design including original research articles consecutively selected, between May 2004 and March 2005, by the Medicina Clinica (Barc) editorial committee. We randomized manuscripts to minimize differences in terms of baseline quality and type of study (intervention, longitudinal, cross-sectional, others). Sample-size calculations indicated that 100 papers provide an 80\% power to test a 55\% standardized difference. We specified the main outcome as the increment in quality of papers as measured on the Goodman Scale. Two blinded evaluators rated the quality of manuscripts at initial submission and final post peer review version. Of the 327 manuscripts submitted to the journal, 131 were accepted for further review, and 129 were randomized. Of those, 14 that were lost to follow-up showed no differences in initial quality to the followed-up papers. Hence, 115 were included in the main analysis, with 16 rejected for publication after peer review. 21 (18.3\%) of the 115 included papers were interventions, 46 (40.0\%) were longitudinal designs, 28 (24.3\%) cross-sectional and 20 (17.4\%) others. The 16 (13.9\%) rejected papers had a significantly lower initial score on the overall Goodman scale than accepted papers (difference 15.0, 95\% CI: 4.6-24.4). The effect of suggesting a guideline to the reviewers had no effect on change in overall quality as measured by the Goodman scale (0.9, 95\% CI: -0.3-+2.1). The estimated effect of adding a statistical reviewer was 5.5 (95\% CI: 4.3-6.7), showing a significant improvement in quality.
CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: This prospective randomized study shows the positive effect of adding a statistical reviewer to the field-expert peers in improving manuscript quality. We did not find a statistically significant positive effect by suggesting reviewers use reporting guidelines.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the compliance, satisfaction and adverse effects of immunomodulating drugs in a German multiple sclerosis (MS) population.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A standardised, anonymous questionnaire was sent to the 1985 members with MS of the Berlin section of the German Multiple Sclerosis Association. Patients were questioned with regards to sociodemographic data, MS-related topics, therapy, adverse effects and compliance. The response rate was 51.1\%, from which 681 patients were selected who were experienced in therapy with interferon beta 1a or 1b or glatiramer acetate.
RESULTS: Most participants were treated with beta-interferons and only one-third with glatiramer acetate. Patients were moderately satisfied with their medication. Approximately 75.5\% of patients had used the medication for longer than 2 years, especially those with a relapsing-remitting course (RRMS). Around one-third of all participants had their immunomodulating drug changed, mostly only once. The main reasons for discontinuation of the therapy were adverse effects, physician's recommendation and lack of treatment effect. Mood-related adverse effects (e.g., depression), fever and pain were perceived as most disturbing. Regression analysis revealed that dependence on a wheelchair and a secondary progressive course predicted a low compliance to treatment.
CONCLUSION: Treating MS is a challenge and to positively influence the course of the disease it is necessary to administer medication in a constant manner. Our data showed a moderate compliance and satisfaction with the immunomodulating medication. Adverse effects and perceived lack of treatment effect were reasons for discontinuation of therapy. To increase compliance and satisfaction with treatment, adequate information about MS, the therapeutic options, handling of medication, side-effects and their management are necessary. Additionally, realistic therapeutic aims should be discussed with the patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Canadian GILENYA® Go ProgramTM provides education and support to people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis during fingolimod treatment.
METHODS: Data were collected and analyzed from the time of the first individual enrolled in March 2011 to March 31, 2014. Individuals were excluded if they withdrew from the program prior to receiving the first dose, or had not completed the first dose observation (FDO) at the time of data cut-off. Reports of adverse effects were validated with a database of adverse events reported to Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc.
RESULTS: A total of 2,399 individuals had completed FDO at the end of the three-year observation period. Mean age was 41.2 years; 75.2\% were female. The most recent prior therapies reported were interferon-β agents (50.2\%), glatiramer acetate (31.1\%), natalizumab (14.2\%), no prior therapy (3.3\%), and other agent (1.1\%). Reasons for switching to fingolimod were lack of efficacy (34.9\%), side effects (34.6\%), and dissatisfaction with injections/infusion (30.4\%). Continuation rates with fingolimod at 12, 24 and 30 months were 80.7\%, 76.6\% and 76.0\%, respectively. The discontinuation rate due to reported lack of efficacy during the three-year period was 1.3\%. There was 94.4\% adherence to the scheduled ophthalmic examination.
CONCLUSIONS: The GILENYA® Go ProgramTM captures data for virtually all fingolimod-treated patients in Canada, enabling the evaluation of fingolimod use in routine practice. Ongoing patient support and reminders to take the medication, in conjunction with physicians' and/or patients' perception of the efficacy and tolerability of fingolimod, resulted in a high rate of continuation during longer-term therapy.},

This is a retrospective, hospital chart-based study of 394 patients treated by a single neurologist for up to eight years. The aims of the study were to ascertain the frequency and timing of IFNB discontinuation in a well supported cohort, and to investigate whether the clinical disease type at the initiation of IFNB or the reason for discontinuation influenced stopping rates. The median follow-up was 49 months. The overall IFNB stopping rate was 28\% over five years; there was a significant difference between the IFNB stopping rates for RRMS (14\%) and SPMS (23\%) after three years of follow-up (P =0.0003). Patients stopped IFNB due to side effects after a median of 13 months, and due to failure of therapy after a median of 35 months (P =0.0004). Significantly more patients with SPMS than with RRMS stopped IFNB due to treatment failure (P =0.037).
CONCLUSION: IFNB discontinuation occurred earlier in the treatment course when due to side effects. Stopping IFNB therapy was more common in SPMS and was more often due to treatment failure than side effects.},

Hence, the usage of B-cell-depleting monoclonal antibodies as therapy for autoimmune diseases including MS lay near at hand. Rituximab was the first therapeutic B-cell-depleting chimeric monoclonal antibody to be used successfully in MS. Ocrelizumab, a second-generation humanized anti-CD20 antibody, was explored in a large phase II, randomized, placebo-controlled multicentre trial in patients with relapsing-remitting disease. Compared with placebo, two doses of ocrelizumab (600 and 2000 mg on days 1 and 15) showed a pronounced effect on disease activity seen in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as gadolinium-enhanced lesions (89\% and 96\% relative reduction, both p {\textless} 0.001) and also had a significant effect on relapses. In exploratory analyses, both doses of ocrelizumab had better effect on gadolinium-enhanced lesions than interferon beta-1a intramuscularly that was used as a reference arm. Adverse effects were mainly infusion-related reactions, in particular during the first infusion. Serious infections occurred at similar rates in ocrelizumab and placebo-treated patients, and no opportunistic infections were reported. However, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has been reported in patients treated with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies for other indications. Other anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies have been tested as treatments for MS, including ofatumumab that has shown beneficial results in placebo-controlled phase II trials in patients with relapsing-remitting MS. Ocrelizumab is now in phase III development for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS, as well as primary progressive MS, and the results of ongoing clinical trials are eagerly awaited and will determine the place of ocrelizumab in the armamentarium of MS therapies.},

Depletion of CD52 expressing T- and B-cells and monocytes by alemtuzumab resulted in impressive and durable suppression of disease activity in RRMS patients. On the other hand, strategies targeting B-cell cytokines such as atacicept resulted in increased disease activity. As our understanding of the biology of B-cells in MS is increasing, new compounds that target B-cells continue to be developed which promise to further expand the armamentarium of MS therapies and allow for more individualized therapy for patients with this complex disease.},

This article focuses on some of the shortcomings of AE reporting in RCTs, especially those involving tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. Discussion focuses on reporting of "time-to-event" issues, use of standardized incidence ratios for comparison to normal population or disease controls, use of "patient-years" when reporting AEs, and the problem of adequate sample size and power calculations that are lacking in safety outcome data trials.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Validation of health administrative data for identifying patients with different health states (diseases and conditions) is a research priority, but no guidelines exist for ensuring quality. We created reporting guidelines for studies validating administrative data identification algorithms and used them to assess the quality of reporting of validation studies in the literature.
METHODS: Using Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic accuracy (STARD) criteria as a guide, we created a 40-item checklist of items with which identification accuracy studies should be reported. A systematic review identified studies that validated identification algorithms using administrative data. We used the checklist to assess the quality of reporting.
RESULTS: In 271 included articles, goals and data sources were well reported but few reported four or more statistical estimates of accuracy (36.9\%). In 65.9\% of studies reporting positive predictive value (PPV)/negative predictive value (NPV), the prevalence of disease in the validation cohort was higher than in the administrative data, potentially falsely elevating predictive values. Subgroup accuracy (53.1\%) and 95\% confidence intervals for accuracy measures (35.8\%) were also underreported.
CONCLUSIONS: The quality of studies validating health states in the administrative data varies, with significant deficits in reporting of markers of diagnostic accuracy, including the appropriate estimation of PPV and NPV. These omissions could lead to misclassification bias and incorrect estimation of incidence and health services utilization rates. Use of a reporting checklist, such as the one created for this study by modifying the STARD criteria, could improve the quality of reporting of validation studies, allowing for accurate application of algorithms, and interpretation of research using health administrative data.},

Little is known about the process and factors involved in changing physician practices in response to guidelines.ObjectiveTo review barriers to physician adherence to clinical practice guidelines.Data SourcesWe searched the MEDLINE, Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC), and HealthSTAR databases (January 1966 to January 1998); bibliographies; textbooks on health behavior or public health; and references supplied by experts to find English-language article titles that describe barriers to guideline adherence.Study SelectionOf 5658 articles initially identified, we selected 76 published studies describing at least 1 barrier to adherence to clinical practice guidelines, practice parameters, clinical policies, or national consensus statements. One investigator screened titles to identify candidate articles, then 2 investigators independently reviewed the texts to exclude articles that did not match the criteria. Differences were resolved by consensus with a third investigator.Data ExtractionTwo investigators organized barriers to adherence into a framework according to their effect on physician knowledge, attitudes, or behavior. This organization was validated by 3 additional investigators.Data SynthesisThe 76 articles included 120 different surveys investigating 293 potential barriers to physician guideline adherence, including awareness (n = 46), familiarity (n = 31), agreement (n = 33), self-efficacy (n = 19), outcome expectancy (n = 8), ability to overcome the inertia of previous practice (n = 14), and absence of external barriers to perform recommendations (n = 34). The majority of surveys (70 [58\%] of 120) examined only 1 type of barrier.ConclusionsStudies on improving physician guideline adherence may not be generalizable, since barriers in one setting may not be present in another. Our review offers a differential diagnosis for why physicians do not follow practice guidelines, as well as a rational approach toward improving guideline adherence and a framework for future research.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of the CONSORT for Abstracts guidelines, and different editorial policies used by five leading general medical journals to implement the guidelines, on the reporting quality of abstracts of randomised trials.
DESIGN: Interrupted time series analysis.
SAMPLE: We randomly selected up to 60 primary reports of randomised trials per journal per year from five high impact, general medical journals in 2006-09, if indexed in PubMed with an electronic abstract. We excluded reports that did not include an electronic abstract, and any secondary trial publications or economic analyses. We classified journals in three categories: those not mentioning the guidelines in their instructions to authors (JAMA and New England Journal of Medicine), those referring to the guidelines in their instructions to authors but with no specific policy to implement them (BMJ), and those referring to the guidelines in their instructions to authors with an active policy to implement them (Annals of Internal Medicine and Lancet). Two authors extracted data independently using the CONSORT for Abstracts checklist.
MAIN OUTCOME: Mean number of CONSORT items reported in selected abstracts, among nine items reported in fewer than 50\% of the abstracts published across the five journals in 2006.
RESULTS: We assessed 955 reports of abstracts of randomised trials. Journals with an active policy to enforce the guidelines showed an immediate increase in the level of mean number of items reported (increase of 1.50 items; P=0.0037). At 23 months after publication of the guidelines, the mean number of items reported per abstract for the primary outcome was 5.41 of nine items, a 53\% increase compared with the expected level estimated on the basis of pre-intervention trends. The change in level or trend did not increase in journals with no policy to enforce the guidelines (BMJ, JAMA, and New England Journal of Medicine).
CONCLUSION: Active implementation of the CONSORT for Abstracts guidelines by journals can lead to improvements in the reporting of abstracts of randomised trials.},

	abstract = {Objectives To examine the reporting characteristics and methodological details of randomised trials indexed in PubMed in 2000 and 2006 and assess whether the quality of reporting has improved after publication of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statement in 2001.
Design Comparison of two cross sectional investigations.
Study sample All primary reports of randomised trials indexed in PubMed in December 2000 (n=519) and December 2006 (n=616), including parallel group, crossover, cluster, factorial, and split body study designs.
Main outcome measures The proportion of general and methodological items reported, stratified by year and study design. Risk ratios with 95\% confidence intervals were calculated to represent changes in reporting between 2000 and 2006.
Results The majority of trials were two arm (379/519 (73\%) in 2000 v 468/616 (76\%) in 2006) parallel group studies (383/519 (74\%) v 477/616 (78\%)) published in specialty journals (482/519 (93\%) v 555/616 (90\%)). In both 2000 and 2006, a median of 80 participants were recruited per trial for parallel group trials. The proportion of articles that reported drug trials decreased between 2000 and 2006 (from 393/519 (76\%) to 356/616 (58\%)), whereas the proportion of surgery trials increased (51/519 (10\%) v 128/616 (21\%)). There was an increase between 2000 and 2006 in the proportion of trial reports that included details of the primary outcome (risk ratio (RR) 1.18, 95\% CI 1.04 to 1.33), sample size calculation (RR 1.66, 95\% CI 1.40 to 1.95), and the methods of random sequence generation (RR 1.62, 95\% CI 1.32 to 1.97) and allocation concealment (RR 1.40, 95\% CI 1.11 to 1.76). There was no difference in the proportion of trials that provided specific details on who was blinded (RR 0.91, 95\% CI 0.75 to 1.10).
Conclusions Reporting of several important aspects of trial methods improved between 2000 and 2006; however, the quality of reporting remains well below an acceptable level. Without complete and transparent reporting of how a trial was designed and conducted, it is difficult for readers to assess its conduct and validity.},

	abstract = {Background The CONSORT Statement is a reporting guideline for authors when reporting randomized controlled trials (RCTs). It offers a standard way for authors to prepare RCT reports. It has been endorsed by many high-impact medical journals and by international editorial groups. This study was conducted to assess the endorsement of the CONSORT Statement by high-impact medical journals in China by reviewing their instructions for authors.   Methodology/Principal Findings A total of 200 medical journals were selected according to the Chinese Science and Technology Journal Citation Reports, 195 of which publish clinical research papers. Their instructions for authors were reviewed and all texts mentioning the CONSORT Statement or CONSORT extension papers were extracted. Any mention of the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals (URM) developed by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) or ‘clinical trial registration’ was also extracted. For journals endorsing the CONSORT Statement, their most recently published RCT reports were retrieved and evaluated to assess whether the journals have followed what the CONSORT Statement required. Out of the 195 medical journals publishing clinical research papers, only six (6/195, 3.08\%) mentioned ‘CONSORT’ in their instructions for authors; out of the 200 medical journals surveyed, only 14 (14/200, 7.00\%) mentioned ‘ICMJE’ or ‘URM’ in their instructions for authors, and another five journals stated in their instructions for authors that clinical trials should have trial registration numbers and that priority would be given to clinical trials which had been registered. Among the 62 RCT reports published in the six journals endorsing the CONSORT Statement, 20 (20/62, 32.26\%) contained flow diagrams and only three (3/62, 4.84\%) provided trial registration information.   Conclusions/Significance Medical journals in China endorsing either the CONSORT Statement or the ICMJE's URM constituted a small percentage of the total; all of these journals used ambiguous language regarding what was expected of authors.},

It is unknown how many journals mention PRISMA in their instructions to authors, or whether stronger journal language regarding use of PRISMA improves author compliance.   Methodology/Principal Findings An Internet-based investigation examined the extent to which 146 leading medical journals have incorporated the PRISMA Statement into their instructions to authors. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Also, systematic reviews published in the leading anesthesiology journals and the QUOROM (QUality Of Reporting Of Meta-analyses) Statement were used to explore the hypothesis that indicating compliance with the QUOROM Statement in the manuscript is associated with improved compliance with the reporting guideline. In a sample of 146 journals publishing systematic reviews, the PRISMA Statement was referred to in the instructions to authors for 27\% (40/146) of journals; more often in general and internal medicine journals (7/14; 50\%) than in specialty medicine journals (33/132; 25\%). In the second part of the study, 13 systematic reviews published in the leading anesthesiology journals in 2008 were included for appraisal. Mention of the QUOROM Statement in the manuscript was associated with higher compliance with the QUOROM checklist (P = 0.022).   Conclusions/Significance Most of the leading medical journals used ambiguous language regarding what was expected of authors. Further improvement on quality of reporting of systematic reviews may entail journals clearly informing authors of their requirements. Stronger directions, such as requiring an indication of adherence to a research quality of reporting statement in the manuscript, may improve reporting and utility of systematic reviews.},

	abstract = {Background

Population-based serologic studies are a vital tool for understanding the epidemiology of influenza and other respiratory viruses, including the early assessment of the transmissibility and severity of the 2009 influenza pandemic, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. However, interpretation of the results of serologic studies has been hampered by the diversity of approaches and the lack of standardized methods and reporting.


Objective

The objective of the CONSISE ROSES-I statement was to improve the quality and transparency of reporting of influenza seroepidemiologic studies and facilitate the assessment of the validity and generalizability of published results.


Methods

The ROSES-I statement was developed as an expert consensus of the CONSISE epidemiology and laboratory working groups. The recommendations are presented in the familiar format of a reporting guideline. Because seroepidemiologic studies are a specific type of observational epidemiology study, the ROSES-I statement is built upon the STROBE guidelines. As such, the ROSES-I statement should be seen as an extension of the STROBE guidelines.


Results

The ROSES-I statement presents 42 items that can be used as a checklist of the information that should be included in the results of published seroepidemiologic studies, and which can also serve as a guide to the items that need to be considered during study design and implementation.


Conclusions

We hope that the ROSES-I statement will contribute to improving the quality of reporting of seroepidemiologic studies.},

	abstract = {The objectives of this study were 1) to find out if and how authors and peer reviewers for dental journals are encouraged to use reporting guidelines (RGs); 2) to identify factors related to RG endorsement; and 3) to assess the knowledge, opinions, and future plans of dental journal editors in chief (EICs) on RGs. A total of 109 peer-reviewed and original research-oriented dental journals that were indexed in the MEDLINE and/or SCIE database in 2015 were included. The "instructions to authors" and "instructions to reviewers" of these journals were identified and retrieved from journals' official websites. Any mention of RGs or other related policies were sought and extracted. In addition, an anonymous survey of the EICs of the included journals was conducted with a validated questionnaire. All 109 journals provided "instructions to authors," among which 55 (50.5\%) mentioned RGs. Only the CONSORT (45.0\%), PRISMA (13.8\%), and STROBE (12.8\%) guidelines were mentioned by {\textgreater}10\% of the included journals. Statistical analyses suggest that RGs were more frequently mentioned by SCIE-indexed journals (P {\textless} 0.001), higher-impact journals (P = 0.002), and journals that endorsed the ICMJE recommendations (P {\textless} 0.001). "Instructions to reviewers" were available online for only 9 journals (8.3\%), 3 of which mentioned RGs. For the EIC survey, the response rate was 32.1\% (35 of 109). Twenty-six editors (74.3\%) stated that they knew what RGs were before receiving our questionnaire. Twenty-four editors (68.6\%) believed that RGs should be adopted by all refereed dental journals where appropriate. RGs are important tools for enhancing research reporting and reducing avoidable research waste, but currently they are not widely endorsed by dental journals. Joint efforts by all stakeholders to further promote RG usage in dentistry are needed.},

	abstract = {Background Pre-publication peer review of manuscripts should enhance the value of research publications to readers who may wish to utilize findings in clinical care or health policy-making. Much published research across all medical specialties is not useful, may be misleading, wasteful and even harmful. Reporting guidelines are tools that in addition to helping authors prepare better manuscripts may help peer reviewers in assessing them. We examined journals' instructions to peer reviewers to see if and how reviewers are encouraged to use them.   Methods We surveyed websites of 116 journals from the McMaster list. Main outcomes were 1) identification of online instructions to peer reviewers and 2) presence or absence of key domains within instructions: on journal logistics, reviewer etiquette and addressing manuscript content (11 domains).   Findings Only 41/116 journals (35\%) provided online instructions. All 41 guided reviewers about the logistics of their review processes, 38 (93\%) outlined standards of behaviour expected and 39 (95\%) contained instruction about evaluating the manuscript content. There was great variation in explicit instruction for reviewers about how to evaluate manuscript content. Almost half of the online instructions 19/41 (46\%) mentioned reporting guidelines usually as general statements suggesting they may be useful or asking whether authors had followed them rather than clear instructions about how to use them. All 19 named CONSORT for reporting randomized trials but there was little mention of CONSORT extensions. PRISMA, QUOROM (forerunner of PRISMA), STARD, STROBE and MOOSE were mentioned by several journals. No other reporting guideline was mentioned by more than two journals.   Conclusions Although almost half of instructions mentioned reporting guidelines, their value in improving research publications is not being fully realised. Journals have a responsibility to support peer reviewers. We make several recommendations including wider reference to the EQUATOR Network online library (www.equator-network.org/).},

	abstract = {Background  In uncontrolled before-after studies, CONSORT was shown to improve the reporting of randomised trials. Before-after studies ignore underlying secular trends and may overestimate the impact of interventions. Our aim was to assess the impact of the 2007 STROBE statement publication on the quality of observational study reporting, using both uncontrolled before-after analyses and interrupted time series.    Methods  For this quasi-experimental study, original articles reporting cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies published between 2004 and 2010 in the four dermatological journals having the highest 5-year impact factors (≥4) were selected. We compared the proportions of STROBE items (STROBE score) adequately reported in each article during three periods,  two pre STROBE period (2004–2005 and 2006–2007) and one post STROBE period (2008–2010).  Segmented regression analysis of interrupted time series was also performed.    Results  Of the 456 included articles, 187 (41\%) reported cohort studies, 166 (36.4\%) cross-sectional studies, and 103 (22.6\%) case-control studies. The median STROBE score was 57\% (range, 18\%–98\%). Before-after analysis evidenced significant STROBE score increases between the two pre-STROBE periods and between the earliest pre-STROBE period and the post-STROBE period (median score 2004–05  48\%  versus  median score 2008–10  58\%,  p \&lt;0.001) but not between the immediate pre-STROBE period and the post-STROBE period (median score 2006–07  58\%  versus  median score 2008–10  58\%,  p  = 0.42).   In the pre STROBE period  , the six-monthly mean STROBE score increased significantly, by 1.19\% per six-month period (absolute increase 95\%CI, 0.26\% to 2.11\%,  p  = 0.016). By segmented analysis, no significant changes in STROBE score trends occurred (−0.40\%; 95\%CI, −2.20 to 1.41;  p  = 0.64)   in the post STROBE statement publication  .    Interpretation  The quality of reports increased over time but was not affected by STROBE. Our findings raise concerns about the relevance of uncontrolled before-after analysis for estimating the impact of guidelines.},

It provides online resources and training relating to the reporting of health research, and assists in the development, dissemination and implementation of reporting guidelines (www.equator-network.org). Poor reporting practices can be decreased only through close collaboration of all parties involved in research and its publication; EQUATOR can facilitate the process.},

	abstract = {Objectives
The introduction of biological therapies for the treatment of rheumatic diseases has drawn attention to the limitations of traditional means of assessing drug safety. Consequently, a series of European academic biologics registers dedicated to this task have been established. Increasing reliance upon safety data generated from observational drug registers makes it important to convert the lessons learned from such registers into recommendations for rheumatologists embarking upon the establishment of future registers, or analysing and reporting from new and existing registers.
Methods
The Task Force encompassed 11 scientists from European Rheumatology drug registers. Through an informal inventory of critical elements in the establishment of existing rheumatoid arthritis drug registers, of analytical strategies used and of limitations of their results, several 'points to consider'-beyond established generic guidelines for observational registers/studies but with particular relevance to biologics registers on safety in rheumatology-were assembled. For each 'point to consider', contextual and methodological background and examples were compiled.
Results
A set of seven points to consider was assembled for the establishment of new drug registers with a focus on purpose, population to be targeted, data collection, handling and storage as well as ethical and legal considerations. For analysis and reporting, nine points to consider were assembled (setting, participant, variable, statistical method, descriptive data, outcome data, main results, other analyses and limitations).
Conclusions
Thoughtful design and planning before the establishment of biologics registers will increase their sustainability, versatility and raw data quality. Harmonisation of analyses and reporting from such registers will improve interpretation of drug safety studies.},

Currently, inconsistencies in the quality and reporting of such studies have placed limits on accurate reliability and impact assessment. Our aim was to develop a checklist of reporting items that should be addressed by authors of original anatomical studies. Materials and Methods: The study steering committee formulated a preliminary conceptual design and began to generate items on the basis of a literature review and expert opinion. This led to the development of a preliminary checklist. The validity of this checklist was assessed by a Delphi procedure, and feedback from the Delphi panelists, who were experts in the area of anatomical research, was used to improve it. Results: The Delphi procedure involved 12 experts in anatomical research. It comprised two rounds, after which unanimous consensus was reached regarding the items to be included in the checklist. The steering committee agreed to name the checklist AQUA. The preliminary AQUA Checklist consisted of 26 items divided into eight sections. Following round 1, some of the items underwent major revision and three new ones were introduced. The checklist was revised only for minor language inaccuracies after round 2. The final version of the AQUA Checklist consisted of the initial eight sections with a total of 29 items. Conclusion: The steering committee hopes the AQUA Checklist will improve the quality and reporting of anatomical studies. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

Summary points
Advances in laboratory techniques have led to a rapidly increasing use of biomarkers in epidemiological studies. Biomarkers of internal dose, early biological change, susceptibility and clinical outcomes are used as proxies for investigating interactions between external and/or endogenous agents and body components or processes. The need for improved reporting of scientific research led to influential statements of recommendations such as the STrengthening Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement. The STROBE initiative established in 2004 aimed to provide guidance on how to report observational research. Its guidelines provide a user-friendly checklist of 22 items to be reported in epidemiological studies, with items specific to the three main study designs: cohort studies, case–control studies and cross-sectional studies. The present STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology –Molecular Epidemiology (STROBE-ME) initiative builds on the STROBE statement implementing nine existing items of STROBE and providing 17 additional items to the 22 items of STROBE checklist. The additions relate to the use of biomarkers in epidemiological studies, concerning collection, handling and storage of biological samples; laboratory methods, validity and reliability of biomarkers; specificities of study design; and ethical considerations. The STROBE-ME recommendations are intended to complement the STROBE recommendations.},

	abstract = {Objective
To investigate whether AGREE II users apply a cut-off based on standardized domain scores or overall guideline quality in order to distinguish between high- and low-quality guidelines, as well as to investigate which criteria they use to generate this cut-off and which type of cut-off they apply.
Study Design and Setting
We conducted a systematic search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, DARE, and the HTA-Database for German- and English-language studies appraising guidelines with AGREE II. Information on cut-offs was extracted and analyzed descriptively.
Results
We identified 118 relevant publications. 39 (33\%) used a cut-off, of which 24 (62\%) used a 2-step and 13 (33\%) used a 3-step approach. The cut-off for high quality lay between 50\%-70\% (2-step) and 60\%-83\% (3-step) of the highest possible rating. 24 (62\%) publications applied a cut-off based on standardized domain scores and 7 (18\%) based on overall guideline quality. 11 (28\%) applied cut-offs to derive the recommendation for guideline use.
Conclusion
A third of AGREE II users apply a cut-off to distinguish between high- and low-quality guidelines, often without clearly describing how the cut-off is generated. Many users might welcome a clear distinction between high- and low-quality guidelines; specifying a cut-off for this purpose might be useful.},

	abstract = {To describe the use and reporting of interrupted time series methods in drug utilization research. We completed a systematic search of MEDLINE, Web of Science, and reference lists to identify English language articles through to December 2013 that used interrupted time series methods in drug utilization research. We tabulated the number of studies by publication year and summarized methodological detail. We identified 220 eligible empirical applications since 1984. Only 17 (8\%) were published before 2000, and 90 (41\%) were published since 2010. Segmented regression was the most commonly applied interrupted time series method (67\%). Most studies assessed drug policy changes (51\%, n = 112); 22\% (n = 48) examined the impact of new evidence, 18\% (n = 39) examined safety advisories, and 16\% (n = 35) examined quality improvement interventions. Autocorrelation was considered in 66\% of studies, 31\% reported adjusting for seasonality, and 15\% accounted for nonstationarity. Use of interrupted time series methods in drug utilization research has increased, particularly in recent years. Despite methodological recommendations, there is large variation in reporting of analytic methods. Developing methodological and reporting standards for interrupted time series analysis is important to improve its application in drug utilization research, and we provide recommendations for consideration.},

The reporting of such research is often inadequate, which hampers the assessment of its strengths and weaknesses and of a study's generalizability. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Initiative developed recommendations on what should be included in an accurate and complete report of an observational study. We defined the scope of the recommendations to cover three main study designs: cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies. We convened a 2-day workshop in September 2004, with methodologists, researchers, and journal editors to draft a checklist of items. This list was subsequently revised during several meetings of the coordinating group and in e-mail discussions with the larger group of STROBE contributors, taking into account empirical evidence and methodological considerations. The workshop and the subsequent iterative process of consultation and revision resulted in a checklist of 22 items (the STROBE Statement) that relate to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of articles. Eighteen items are common to all three study designs and four are specific for cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional studies. A detailed Explanation and Elaboration document is published separately and is freely available on the web sites of PLoS Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine, and Epidemiology. We hope that the STROBE Statement will contribute to improving the quality of reporting of observational studies.},

The criteria for assessment were reported in 97\% of the reviews but were defined in only 38\%. Seventy-four different items and 26 different scales were identified. Allocation sequence generation and concealment were reported in 41\% and 40\%, respectively, but their adequacy was assessed in 20\% and 29\%, respectively; scales were used in 40\% and Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist in 12\%.

To utilize the strength of this design, a modification to standard regression analysis, such as segmented regression, is required. In segmented regression analysis, the change in intercept and/or slope from pre- to post-intervention is estimated and used to test causal hypotheses about the intervention. We illustrate segmented regression using data from a previously published study that evaluated the effectiveness of a collaborative intervention to improve quality in pre-hospital ambulance care for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and stroke. In the original analysis, a standard regression model was used with time as a continuous variable. We contrast the results from this standard regression analysis with those from segmented regression analysis. We discuss the limitations of the former and advantages of the latter, as well as the challenges of using segmented regression in analysing complex quality improvement interventions.},

	abstract = {In 2003, the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD) statement was published in 13 biomedical journals.1 ,2 Diagnostic accuracy studies provide estimates of a test's ability to discriminate between patients with and without a predefined condition, by comparing the test results against a clinical reference standard. The STARD initiative was developed in response to accumulating evidence of poor methodological quality and poor reporting among test accuracy studies in the prior years.3 ,4 The STARD checklist contains 25 items which invite authors and reviewers to verify that critical information about the study is included in the study report. In addition, a flow chart that specifies the number of included and excluded patients and characterises the flow of participants through the study is strongly recommended. Since its launch, the STARD checklist has been adopted by over 200 biomedical journals (http://www.stard-statement.org/).

Over the past 20 years, reporting guidelines have been developed and evaluated in many different fields of research. Although a modest increase in reporting quality is sometimes noticed in the years following the introduction of such guidelines,5 ,6 improvements in adherence tend to be slow.7 This makes it difficult to make statements about the impact of such guidelines. For STARD, there has been some controversy around its effect.8 While one study noticed a small increase in reporting quality of diagnostic accuracy studies shortly after the introduction of STARD,9 another study could not confirm this.10

Systematic reviews can provide more precise and more generalisable estimates of effect. A recently published systematic review evaluated adherence to several reporting guidelines in different fields of research, but STARD was not among the evaluated guidelines.11 To fill this gap, we systematically reviewed all the studies that aimed to investigate diagnostic accuracy studies’ adherence to …},

	abstract = {Objective
To improve the accuracy and completeness of reporting of studies of diagnostic accuracy, to allow readers to assess the potential for bias in a study, and to evaluate a study's generalisability.

Methods
The Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) steering committee searched the literature to identify publications on the appropriate conduct and reporting of diagnostic studies and extracted potential items into an extensive list. Researchers, editors, and members of professional organisations shortened this list during a two day consensus meeting, with the goal of developing a checklist and a generic flow diagram for studies of diagnostic accuracy.

Results
The search for published guidelines about diagnostic research yielded 33 previously published checklists, from which we extracted a list of 75 potential items. At the consensus meeting, participants shortened the list to a 25 item checklist, by using evidence, whenever available. A prototype of a flow diagram provides information about the method of patient recruitment, the order of test execution, and the numbers of patients undergoing the test under evaluation and the reference standard, or both.

Conclusions
Evaluation of research depends on complete and accurate reporting. If medical journals adopt the STARD checklist and flow diagram, the quality of reporting of studies of diagnostic accuracy should improve to the advantage of clinicians, researchers, reviewers, journals, and the public.},

	abstract = {Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). There is currently no single definitive test for MS. Circulating exosomes represent promising candidate biomarkers for a host of human diseases. Exosomes contain RNA, DNA, and proteins, can cross the blood-brain barrier, and are secreted from almost all cell types including cells of the CNS. We hypothesized that serum exosomal miRNAs could present a useful blood-based assay for MS disease detection and monitoring. Exosome-associated microRNAs in serum samples from MS patients (n = 25) and matched healthy controls (n = 11) were profiled using small RNA next generation sequencing. We identified differentially expressed exosomal miRNAs in both relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) (miR-15b-5p, miR-451a, miR-30b-5p, miR-342-3p) and progressive MS patient sera (miR-127-3p, miR-370-3p, miR-409-3p, miR-432-5p) in relation to controls. Critically, we identified a group of nine miRNAs (miR-15b-5p, miR-23a-3p, miR-223-3p, miR-374a-5p, miR-30b-5p, miR-433-3p, miR-485-3p, miR-342-3p, miR-432-5p) that distinguished relapsing-remitting from progressive disease. Eight out of nine miRNAs were validated in an independent group (n = 11) of progressive MS cases. This is the first demonstration that microRNAs associated with circulating exosomes are informative biomarkers not only for the diagnosis of MS, but in predicting disease subtype with a high degree of accuracy.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: (i) To determine the prevalence of multiple sclerosis (MS) in New South Wales and South Australia; (ii) to compare these prevalences with those in other areas of Australia and to determine the relationship between prevalence and latitude; (iii) to examine the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors in the aetiology of the disease in Australia; and (iv) to ascertain whether there had been a change in the frequency of the disease since 1961.
RESULTS: The crude prevalence of MS in New South Wales on prevalence day (National Census Day, 30 June 1981) was 37.2/100,000 and the age-standardised prevalence 36.6/100,000. The female:male ratio was 2.3:1. The crude prevalence in South Australia was 29.4/100,000 and the age-standardised prevalence 28.8/100,000. The female:male ratio was 2.4:1. No Aborigines or Torres Strait Islanders with MS were identified. There was a significant increase in the prevalence with increasing south latitude in Australia, MS being about seven times more frequent in Hobart than in tropical Queensland, but no genetic differences were found in the surveyed population in different parts of Australia. A significant increase in the prevalence of MS occurred in most areas of Australia between 1961 and 1981, but this may not reflect a true increase in incidence.
CONCLUSION: The increasing prevalence with increasing south latitude cannot readily be explained by genetic susceptibility, and suggests that environmental factors are important for expression of the disease.},

	abstract = {Information technology (IT) acceptance research has yielded many competing models, each with different sets of acceptance determinants. In this paper, we (1) review user acceptance literature and discuss eight prominent models, (2) empirically compare the eight models and their extensions, (3) formulate a unified model that integrates elements across the eight models, and (4) empirically validate the unified model. The eight models reviewed are the theory of reasoned action, the technology acceptance model, the motivational model, the theory of planned behavior, a model combining the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior, the model of PC utilization, the innovation diffusion theory, and the social cognitive theory. Using data from four organizations over a six-month period with three points of measurement, the eight models explained between 17 percent and 53 percent of the variance in user intentions to use information technology. Next, a unified model, called the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), was formulated, with four core determinants of intention and usage, and up to four moderators of key relationships. UTAUT was then tested using the original data and found to outperform the eight individual models (adjusted R of 69 percent). UTAUT was then confirmed with data from two new organizations with similar results (adjusted R of 70 percent). UTAUT thus provides a useful tool for managers needing to assess the likelihood of success for new technology introductions and helps them understand the drivers of acceptance in order to proactively design interventions (including training, marketing, etc.) targeted at populations of users that may be less inclined to adopt and use new systems. The paper also makes several recommendations for future research including developing a deeper understanding of the dynamic influences studied here, refining measurement of the core constructs used in UTAUT, and understanding the organizational outcomes associated with new technology use.},

A brain MR imaging with gadolinium is recommended for the diagnosis of MS. A spinal cord MR imaging is recommended if the brain MR imaging is nondiagnostic or if the presenting symptoms are at the level of the spinal cord. A follow-up brain MR imaging with gadolinium is recommended to demonstrate dissemination in time and ongoing clinically silent disease activity while on treatment, to evaluate unexpected clinical worsening, to re-assess the original diagnosis, and as a new baseline before starting or modifying therapy. A routine brain MR imaging should be considered every 6 months to 2 years for all patients with relapsing MS. The brain MR imaging protocol includes 3D T1-weighted, 3D T2-FLAIR, 3D T2-weighted, post-single-dose gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted sequences, and a DWI sequence. The progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy surveillance protocol includes FLAIR and DWI sequences only. The spinal cord MR imaging protocol includes sagittal T1-weighted and proton attenuation, STIR or phase-sensitive inversion recovery, axial T2- or T2*-weighted imaging through suspicious lesions, and, in some cases, postcontrast gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted imaging. The clinical question being addressed should be provided in the requisition for the MR imaging. The radiology report should be descriptive, with results referenced to previous studies. MR imaging studies should be permanently retained and available. The current revision incorporates new clinical information and imaging techniques that have become more available.},

	abstract = {Objectives To explore the accuracy of application of the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) tool in epidemiological studies focused on the evaluation of the role of antibiotics in selecting resistance, and to derive and test an extension of STROBE to improve the suitability of the tool in evaluating the quality of reporting in these area.
Methods A three-step study was performed. First, a systematic review of the literature analysing the association between antimicrobial exposure and acquisition of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and/or multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii was performed. Second, articles were reviewed according to the STROBE checklist for epidemiological studies. Third, a set of potential new items focused on antimicrobial-resistance quality indicators was derived through an expert two-round RAND-modified Delphi procedure and tested on the articles selected through the literature review.
Results The literature search identified 78 studies. Overall, the quality of reporting appeared to be poor in most areas. Five STROBE items, comprising statistical analysis and study objectives, were satisfactory in {\textless}25\% of the studies. Informative abstract, reporting of bias, control of confounding, generalisability and description of study size were missing in more than half the articles. A set of 21 new items was developed and tested. The new items focused particularly on the study setting, antimicrobial usage indicators, and patients epidemiological and clinical characteristics. The performance of the new items in included studies was very low ({\textless}25\%).
Conclusions Our paper reveals that reporting in epidemiological papers analysing the association between antimicrobial usage and development of resistance is poor. The implementation of the newly developed STROBE for antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) tool should enhance appropriate study design and reporting, and therefore contribute to the improvement of evidence to be used for AMS programme development and assessment.},

Evaluations assessing the completeness of reporting of RCTs based on any of 27 outcomes formulated based on the 1996 or 2001 CONSORT checklists were included; two primary comparisons were evaluated. The 27 outcomes were: the 22 items of the 2001 CONSORT checklist, four sub-items describing blinding and a ‘total summary score’ of aggregate items, as reported. Relative risks (RR) and 99\% confidence intervals were calculated to determine effect estimates for each outcome across evaluations.

Results
Fifty-three reports describing 50 evaluations of 16,604 RCTs were assessed for adherence to at least one of 27 outcomes. Sixty-nine of 81 meta-analyses show relative benefit from CONSORT endorsement on completeness of reporting. Between endorsing and non-endorsing journals, 25 outcomes are improved with CONSORT endorsement, five of these significantly (α = 0.01). The number of evaluations per meta-analysis was often low with substantial heterogeneity; validity was assessed as low or unclear for many evaluations.

Conclusions
The results of this review suggest that journal endorsement of CONSORT may benefit the completeness of reporting of RCTs they publish. No evidence suggests that endorsement hinders the completeness of RCT reporting. However, despite relative improvements when CONSORT is endorsed by journals, the completeness of reporting of trials remains sub-optimal. Journals are not sending a clear message about endorsement to authors submitting manuscripts for publication. As such, fidelity of endorsement as an ‘intervention’ has been weak to date. Journals need to take further action regarding their endorsement and implementation of CONSORT to facilitate accurate, transparent and complete reporting of trials.},

As clinician-teachers in a resource-constrained environment, we investigated whether heuristic evaluation of our multimedia e-learning resource by a panel of experts would be an effective and efficient alternative to testing with end users. We engaged six inspectors, whose expertise included usability, e-learning, instructional design, medical informatics, and the content area of nephrology. They applied a set of commonly used heuristics to identify usability problems, assigning severity scores to each problem. The identification of serious problems was compared with problems previously found by user testing. The panel completed their evaluations within 1 wk and identified a total of 22 distinct usability problems, 11 of which were considered serious. The problems violated the heuristics of visibility of system status, user control and freedom, match with the real world, intuitive visual layout, consistency and conformity to standards, aesthetic and minimalist design, error prevention and tolerance, and help and documentation. Compared with user testing, heuristic evaluation found most, but not all, of the serious problems. Combining heuristic evaluation and user testing, with each involving a small number of participants, may be an effective and efficient way of improving the usability of e-learning materials. Heuristic evaluation should ideally be used first to identify the most obvious problems and, once these are fixed, should be followed by testing with typical end users.},

Most of the guidelines (n=76; 94\%) include a checklist of recommended reporting items, with a median of 21 checklist items (range: 5–64 items). Forty-seven (58\%) reporting guidelines were classified as new guidance. Explanation documents were developed for 11 (14\%) reporting guidelines. Reporting-guideline developers provided little information about the guideline development process. Developers of 50 (62\%) reporting guidelines encouraged endorsement, most commonly by including guidelines in journal instructions to authors (n=18; 36\%). Reporting-guideline developers need to endeavor to maximize the quality of their product. Recently developed guidance is likely to facilitate more robust guideline development. Journal editors can be more confident in endorsing reporting guidelines that have followed these approaches.},

	abstract = {Misinterpretation and abuse of statistical tests, confidence intervals, and statistical power have been decried for decades, yet remain rampant. A key problem is that there are no interpretations of these concepts that are at once simple, intuitive, correct, and foolproof. Instead, correct use and interpretation of these statistics requires an attention to detail which seems to tax the patience of working scientists. This high cognitive demand has led to an epidemic of shortcut definitions and interpretations that are simply wrong, sometimes disastrously so—and yet these misinterpretations dominate much of the scientific literature. In light of this problem, we provide definitions and a discussion of basic statistics that are more general and critical than typically found in traditional introductory expositions. Our goal is to provide a resource for instructors, researchers, and consumers of statistics whose knowledge of statistical theory and technique may be limited but who wish to avoid and spot misinterpretations. We emphasize how violation of often unstated analysis protocols (such as selecting analyses for presentation based on the P values they produce) can lead to small P values even if the declared test hypothesis is correct, and can lead to large P values even if that hypothesis is incorrect. We then provide an explanatory list of 25 misinterpretations of P values, confidence intervals, and power. We conclude with guidelines for improving statistical interpretation and reporting.},

	abstract = {During recent decades numerous feminist scholars have scrutinized the two-sex model and questioned its status in Western societies and medicine. Along the same line, increased attention has been paid to individuals' experiences of atypical sex development, also known as intersex or ‘disorders of sex development’ (DSD). Yet research on individuals' experiences of finding out about their atypical sex development in adolescence has been scarce. Against this backdrop, the present article analyses 23 in-depth interviews with women who in their teens found out about their atypical sex development. The interviews were conducted during 2009–2012 and the interviewees were all Swedish. Drawing on feminist research on female embodiment and social scientific studies on diagnosis, I examine how the women make sense of their bodies and situations. First, I aim to explore how the women construe normality as they negotiate female embodiment. Second, I aim to investigate how the divergent manners in which these negotiations are expressed can be further understood via the women's different access to a diagnosis. Through a thematic and interpretative analysis, I outline two negotiation strategies: the “differently normal” and the “normally different” strategy. In the former, the women present themselves as just slightly different from ‘normal’ women. In the latter, they stress that everyone is different in some manner and thereby claim normalcy. The analysis shows that access to diagnosis corresponds to the ways in which the women present themselves as “differently normal” and “normally different”, thus shedding light on the complex role of diagnosis in their negotiations of female embodiment. It also reveals that the women make use of what they do have and how alignments with and work on norms interplay as normality is construed.},

	abstract = {This paper is a review of some of the recent publications regarding outcome of DSD patients, with an emphasis upon surgical and sexual outcomes. Currently available outcome studies of patients with DSDs have limitations because of multiple factors, including lack of representative patient sampling, and lack of adequate information concerning both medical and surgical care, and psychological, social and family support. The most frequent reports involve females with 21-α-hydroxylase deficiency congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). This most common form of DSD, if one excludes hypospadias and cryptorchidism, is an excellent example of a form of DSD in which all aspects of outcome, regarding surgery, sexual functionality and sensitivity, psychological input and endocrine hormonal therapy, carry a major role. The goals of therapy include a surgical outcome with a good cosmetic appearance and functionality with potential for sexual intercourse with sufficient sensitivity for satisfactory responsiveness. Endocrine replacement therapy should provide a normal adrenal hormonal milieu, while sex steroid therapy may be indicated. Psychological care should be provided from birth with gradual transition primarily to the patient, including basic counseling with full disclosure, although adjustment depends upon the patient's personality and parents' abilities and acceptance. Among forms of DSD involving gonadal insufficiency, hormonal replacement therapy should provide physiologic levels. Among females, estrogen therapy enhances healing after feminizing surgery and is required from puberty throughout adult life to maintain femininity, sexual organs and bone health, and enhance gender and sexuality. Among males, appropriate testosterone therapy maintains stamina, muscle tone, bone health, libido, sexual potency and general well-being, while benefit for healing after genital surgery is unclear. Further, outcome is clearly related to predominant cultural factors. Outcome studies should include evaluation of all of these factors.},

The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the level and quality of detail reported about these factors in order to generate best practice guidelines for reporting of future studies. A systematic search of the literature was conducted to identify studies which examined any outcome measure relating to AFO use in children with CP. A customized checklist was developed for data extraction and quality assessment. There was substantial variability in the level and quality of detail reported across the 41-paper yield. Many papers reported insufficient detail to allow synthesis of outcomes across studies. The findings of this review have been used to generate guidelines for best practice of reporting for AFO intervention studies. It is important to ensure homogeneity of gait pattern in a subject sample or to subdivide a sample to investigate the possibility that heterogeneity affected results. It is also important to describe the orthosis in sufficient detail that the device can be accurately replicated because differences in designs have been shown to affect outcomes. These guidelines will help researchers provide more systematic and detailed reports and thereby permit future reviewers to more accurately assess both the reporting and quality of orthotic interventions, and will facilitate synthesis of literature to enhance the evidence base.},

{\textgreater} —Atul Gawande1

Unless research is properly reported, the work of investigators, subjects, and editors is ultimately wasted. And yet the ongoing problem of poor scientific reporting of research continues to be documented almost on a monthly basis,2,3 and this fact remains a major source of concern for the scientific community and public. Indeed, poor scientific reporting is thought to be a critical factor in the current crisis of irreproducibility described across multiple disciplines.4

In the medical fields, this problem has been long known and insufficiently tackled.5 A recent blog post by Doug Altman recalled a Lancet article from the 1970s that reported assignment of a cohort to treatments as being “more or less randomly allocated”.6 This clearly confusing and unhelpful phrase triggered Dr Altman’s crusading interest in improving the rigor of scientific reporting, such as his role in establishing the Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research (EQUATOR) Network. This network collects and supplies researchers with {\textgreater}300 guidelines and extensions like the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials), PRISMA, STROBE, and RECORD.7 All were designed to improve scientific reporting across study designs ranging from clinical trials to secondary data analyses …},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of core outcome sets (COS) ensures that researchers measure and report those outcomes that are most likely to be relevant to users of their research. Several hundred COS projects have been systematically identified to date, but there has been no formal quality assessment of these studies. The Core Outcome Set-STAndards for Development (COS-STAD) project aimed to identify minimum standards for the design of a COS study agreed upon by an international group, while other specific guidance exists for the final reporting of COS development studies (Core Outcome Set-STAndards for Reporting [COS-STAR]).
METHODS AND FINDINGS: An international group of experienced COS developers, methodologists, journal editors, potential users of COS (clinical trialists, systematic reviewers, and clinical guideline developers), and patient representatives produced the COS-STAD recommendations to help improve the quality of COS development and support the assessment of whether a COS had been developed using a reasonable approach. An open survey of experts generated an initial list of items, which was refined by a 2-round Delphi survey involving nearly 250 participants representing key stakeholder groups. Participants assigned importance ratings for each item using a 1-9 scale. Consensus that an item should be included in the set of minimum standards was defined as at least 70\% of the voting participants from each stakeholder group providing a score between 7 and 9. The Delphi survey was followed by a consensus discussion with the study management group representing multiple stakeholder groups. COS-STAD contains 11 minimum standards that are the minimum design recommendations for all COS development projects. The recommendations focus on 3 key domains: the scope, the stakeholders, and the consensus process.
CONCLUSIONS: The COS-STAD project has established 11 minimum standards to be followed by COS developers when planning their projects and by users when deciding whether a COS has been developed using reasonable methods.},

	abstract = {BackgroundCurrent understanding of the onset of inflammatory bowel diseases relies heavily on data derived from animal models of colitis. However, the omission of information concerning the method used makes the interpretation of studies difficult or impossible. We assessed the current quality of methods reporting in 4 animal models of colitis that are used to inform clinical research into inflammatory bowel disease: dextran sulfate sodium, interleukin-10−/−, CD45RBhigh T cell transfer, and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS).MethodsWe performed a systematic review based on PRISMA guidelines, using a PubMed search (2000–2014) to obtain publications that used a microarray to describe gene expression in colitic tissue. Methods reporting quality was scored against a checklist of essential and desirable criteria.ResultsFifty-eight articles were identified and included in this review (29 dextran sulfate sodium, 15 interleukin-10−/−, 5 T cell transfer, and 16 TNBS; some articles use more than 1 colitis model). A mean of 81.7\% (SD = ±7.038) of criteria were reported across all models. Only 1 of the 58 articles reported all essential criteria on our checklist. Animal age, gender, housing conditions, and mortality/morbidity were all poorly reported.ConclusionsFailure to include all essential criteria is a cause for concern; this failure can have large impact on the quality and replicability of published colitis experiments. We recommend adoption of our checklist as a requirement for publication to improve the quality, comparability, and standardization of colitis studies and will make interpretation and translation of data to human disease more reliable.},

Improving the quality of how PPI is reported is critical in developing a higher quality evidence base to gain a better insight into the methods and impact of PPI. This paper describes the methods used to develop and gain consensus on guidelines for reporting PPI in research studies (updated version of the Guidance for Reporting Patient and Public Involvement (GRIPP2)).
Methods There were three key stages in the development of GRIPP2: identification of key items for the guideline from systematic review evidence of the impact of PPI on health research and health services, a three-phase online Delphi survey with a diverse sample of experts in PPI to gain consensus on included items and a face-to-face consensus meeting to finalise and reach definitive agreement on GRIPP2. Challenges and lessons learnt during the development of the reporting guidelines are reported.
Discussion The process of reaching consensus is vital within the development of guidelines and policy directions, although debate around how best to reach consensus is still needed. This paper discusses the critical stages of consensus development as applied to the development of consensus for GRIPP2 and discusses the benefits and challenges of consensus development.},

	abstract = {Background: As more and more researchers are turning to big data for new opportunities of biomedical discoveries, machine learning models, as the backbone of big data analysis, are mentioned more often in biomedical journals. However, owing to the inherent complexity of machine learning methods, they are prone to misuse. Because of the flexibility in specifying machine learning models, the results are often insufficiently reported in research articles, hindering reliable assessment of model validity and consistent interpretation of model outputs. Objective: To attain a set of guidelines on the use of machine learning predictive models within clinical settings to make sure the models are correctly applied and sufficiently reported so that true discoveries can be distinguished from random coincidence. Methods: A multidisciplinary panel of machine learning experts, clinicians, and traditional statisticians were interviewed, using an iterative process in accordance with the Delphi method. Results: The process produced a set of guidelines that consists of (1) a list of reporting items to be included in a research article and (2) a set of practical sequential steps for developing predictive models. Conclusions: A set of guidelines was generated to enable correct application of machine learning models and consistent reporting of model specifications and results in biomedical research. We believe that such guidelines will accelerate the adoption of big data analysis, particularly with machine learning methods, in the biomedical research community.

	doi = {10.1016/j.wneu.2018.01.171},
	abstract = {OBJECT: Case control and cohort studies are common research designs in neurosurgery. But the term "case-control study" (CCS) is frequently misused in the neurosurgical literature with many articles reported as CCS, even though their methodology does not respect the basic components of a CCS. We sought to estimate the extent of these discrepancies in neurosurgical literature, explore factors contributing to mislabeling and shed some light on study design reporting.
METHODS: We identified 31 top-ranking pure neurosurgical journals and searched them for manuscripts reported as CCS, either in the title or the abstract. The manuscripts were read to determine if they really were CCS according to the STROBE guidelines. Manuscript assessment was conducted in duplicate [Agreement (Kappa Statistics) =99.82 \%].
RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty-four articles met our inclusion criteria of which 133 (59.38\%) correctly labeled the case control design whereas 91 articles (40.62\%) misclassified this study design. Cohort studies (CS) were the most common design mislabeled as "case-control" studies in 76 articles (33.93\%), of which 57 articles (25.45\%) were retrospective CS. The mislabeling of CCS impairs the appropriate indexing, classification and sorting of evidence. Mislabeling CS for CCS leads to a downgrading of evidence as CS represent the highest level of evidence for observational studies. Odds ratios instead of relative risk are reported for these studies resulting into a distortion of the measurement of the effect size, compounded when these are summarized in systematic reviews and pooled in meta-analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: A considerable proportion of studies reported as CCS are not true CCS. Reporting guidelines should include items that ensure that studies are labeled correctly. STROBE guidelines be implemented in assessment of observational studies. Researchers in neurosurgery need better training in research methods and terminology. We also recommend accrued vigilance from reviewers and editors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A comprehensive approach to the evaluation of biologic therapies for musculoskeletal conditions is required to guide appropriate future use. Clinical studies evaluating platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are limited by inadequate reporting of scientific details critical to outcome. We developed minimum reporting requirements for clinical studies evaluating PRP and MSCs using Delphi consensus methods.
METHODS: The need for consensus on the minimum reporting requirements for studies evaluating biologics was identified at the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons/Orthopaedic Research Society (AAOS/ORS) Biologic Treatments for Orthopaedic Injuries Symposium in 2015 and the American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine (AOSSM) Biologic Treatments for Sports Injuries II Think Tank in 2015. A working group facilitated the development of 2 expert consensus statements for PRP and MSCs using Delphi techniques. Exhaustive lists of items that could be reported on by clinical studies evaluating PRP or MSCs were generated by searching the published literature and protocols. PRP and MSC expert groups, each made up of 24 invited speakers at the AAOS and AOSSM symposia, were surveyed on 3 occasions to establish consensus on the inclusion of each item within minimum reporting guidelines. In addition to rating their agreement, the experts were encouraged to propose further items or modifications. Predefined criteria were used to refine item lists after each survey. Final lists were compiled into checklist statements by the working group.
RESULTS: For PRP, the working group identified 93 experimental information items from the literature. Twenty-three experts (96\%) completed 3 rounds of surveys. After 3 rounds, 58 items generated consensus with {\textgreater}75\% agreement and {\textless}5\% disagreement. These items were compiled into a 23-statement checklist. For MSCs, 103 items were identified from the published literature. Twenty-three experts (96\%) completed 3 rounds of surveys. After 3 rounds, the 61 items for which consensus was reached were compiled into a 25-statement checklist.
CONCLUSIONS: This study has established expert consensus on the minimum reporting requirements for clinical studies evaluating PRP and MSCs.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These checklists provide specifications for the minimum information that should be reported by clinical studies evaluating PRP or MSCs.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}When using observational data, quantifying the effect of treatment duration on survival outcomes is not straightforward because only people who live for a long time can receive treatment for a long time. This problem doesn’t apply to randomised trials because people are classified based on the treatment duration they are assigned, rather than the treatment duration that they achieve. This approach accepts that dead people do not deviate from their assigned treatment strategy. By transferring this insight to the analysis of observational data, we can follow three steps to estimate the effect of treatment duration from observational data without the bias of naive comparisons between long term and short term users. The first step is cloning people to assign them to multiple treatment strategies. The second step is censoring clones when they deviate from their assigned treatment strategy. The third step is performing inverse probability weighting to adjust for the potential selection bias introduced by censoring. The procedure can be used to compare any treatment strategies that are sustained over time. Cloning, censoring, and weighting eliminates immortal time bias in the estimates of absolute and relative risk, which helps researchers focus their attention on other biases that may be present in observational analyses and are not so easily eliminated.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Background: Interaction refers to the situation in which the effect of 1 exposure on an outcome differs across strata of another exposure. We did a survey of epidemiologic studies published in leading journals to examine how interaction is assessed and reported.
        Methods: We selected 150 case-control and 75 cohort studies published between May 2001 and May 2007 in leading general medicine, epidemiology, and clinical specialist journals. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics.
        Results: Of the 225 studies, 138 (61\%) addressed interaction. Among these, 25 (18\%) presented no data or only a P value or a statement of statistical significance; 40 (29\%) presented stratum-specific effect estimates but no meaningful comparison of these estimates; and 58 (42\%) presented stratum-specific estimates and appropriate tests for interaction. Fifteen articles (11\%) presented the individual effects of both exposures and also their joint effect or a product term, providing sufficient information to interpret interaction on an additive and multiplicative scale. Reporting was poorest in articles published in clinical specialist articles and most adequate in articles published in general medicine journals, with epidemiology journals in an intermediate position.
        Conclusions: A majority of articles reporting cohort and case-control studies address possible interactions between exposures. However, in about half of these, the information provided was unsatisfactory, and only 1 in 10 studies reported data that allowed readers to interpret interaction effects on an additive and multiplicative scale.},

Guidelines may be inevitable, but they can foster ossification and be counterproductive. Who today would be happy with epidemiology guidelines issued in, say, 1960, 1970, 1980, or even, 1990? One solution is to offer each set of guidelines with an expiration date, beyond which it would cease to apply. Such a policy would at least prompt revisions. We propose that the STROBE guidelines might expire on 31 December 2010 or 3 years after any revision.},

	abstract = {Background The debate about the value of biomedical publications led to recommendations for improving reporting quality. It is unclear to what extent these recommendations have been endorsed by journals. We analyzed whether specific recommendations were included in author instructions, which journal characteristics were associated with their endorsement, how endorsement of the domains changed and whether endorsement was associated with change of impact factor between 2010 and 2015.   Methods We considered two study samples consisting of “Hematology” and “Oncology” journals of the Journal Citation Report 2008 and 2014, respectively. We extracted information regarding endorsement of the (1) recommendations of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, of (2) reporting guidelines, (3) requirement for trial registration and (4) disclosure of conflicts of interest. Data extraction was done by reading the author instructions before conducting a text search with keywords. We calculated a global generalized linear mixed effects model for endorsement of each of the four domains followed by separate multivariable logistic regression models and a longitudinal analysis. We defined endorsement as the author instructions saying that they approve the use of the recommendations.   Results In 2015, the ICMJE recommendations were mentioned in author instructions of 156 journals (67.5\%). CONSORT was referred to by 77 journals (33.3\%); MOOSE, PRISMA, STARD and STROBE were referred to by less than 15\% of journals. There were 99 journals (42.9\%) that recommended or required trial registration, 211 (91.3\%) required authors to disclose conflicts of interest. Journal impact factor, journal start year and geographical region were positively associated with endorsement of any of the four domains. The overall endorsement of all domains increased between 2010 and 2015. The endorsement of any domain in 2010 seemed to be associated with an increased impact factor in 2014.   Conclusion Hematology and oncology journals endorse major recommendations to various degrees. Endorsement is increasing slowly over time and might be positively associated with the journals’ impact factor.},

There is, however, concern that rewarding scientists chiefly on publication creates a perverse incentive, allowing careless and fraudulent conduct to thrive, compounded by the predisposition of top-tier journals towards novel, positive findings rather than investigations confirming null hypothesis. This potentially compounds a reproducibility crisis in several fields, and risks undermining science and public trust in scientific findings. To date, there has been comparatively little modelling on factors that influence science trustworthiness, despite the importance of quantifying the problem. We present a simple phenomenological model with cohorts of diligent, careless and unethical scientists, with funding allocated by published outputs. This analysis suggests that trustworthiness of published science in a given field is influenced by false positive rate, and pressures for positive results. We find decreasing available funding has negative consequences for resulting trustworthiness, and examine strategies to combat propagation of irreproducible science.},

	doi = {10.2196/jmir.4954},
	abstract = {Background
Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is a method of collecting real-time data based on careful timing, repeated measures, and observations that take place in a participant’s typical environment. Due to methodological advantages and rapid advancement in mobile technologies in recent years, more studies have adopted EMA in addressing topics of nutrition and physical activity in youth.

Objective
The aim of this systematic review is to describe EMA methodology that has been used in studies addressing nutrition and physical activity in youth and provide a comprehensive checklist for reporting EMA studies.

Methods
Thirteen studies were reviewed and analyzed for the following 5 areas of EMA methodology: (1) sampling and measures, (2) schedule, (3) technology and administration, (4) prompting strategy, and (5) response and compliance.

Results
Results of this review showed a wide variability in the design and reporting of EMA studies in nutrition and physical activity among youth. The majority of studies (69\%) monitored their participants during one period of time, although the monitoring period ranged from 4 to 14 days, and EMA surveys ranged from 2 to 68 times per day. More than half (54\%) of the studies employed some type of electronic technology. Most (85\%) of the studies used interval-contingent prompting strategy. For studies that utilized electronic devices with interval-contingent prompting strategy, none reported the actual number of EMA prompts received by participants out of the intended number of prompts. About half (46\%) of the studies failed to report information about EMA compliance rates. For those who reported, compliance rates ranged from 44-96\%, with an average of 71\%.

Conclusions
Findings from this review suggest that in order to identify best practices for EMA methodology in nutrition and physical activity research among youth, more standardized EMA reporting is needed. Missing the key information about EMA design features and participant compliance might lead to misinterpretation of results. Future nutrition and physical activity EMA studies need to be more rigorous and thorough in descriptions of methodology and results. A reporting checklist was developed with the goal of enhancing reliability, efficacy, and overall interpretation of the findings for future studies that use EMAs.},

To our knowledge, in typical cohort studies with encounters occurring at regular or irregular intervals, there is no consensus on how to handle person-time between participants’ last study encounter and the point at which they meet a definition of loss to follow-up. We demonstrate, using simulation and an example, that when the event of interest is captured outside of a study encounter (e.g., in a registry), person-time should be censored when the study-defined criterion for loss to follow-up is met (e.g., 1 year after last encounter), rather than at the last study encounter. Conversely, when the event of interest must be measured within the context of a study encounter (e.g., a biomarker value), person-time should be censored at the last study encounter. An inappropriate censoring scheme has the potential to result in substantial bias that may not be easily corrected.},

The proportion of the population with health insurance was 90\% in the US, lower than the other countries (range, 99\%-100\%), and the US had the highest proportion of private health insurance (55.3\%). For some determinants of health such as smoking, the US ranked second lowest of the countries (11.4\% of the US population ≥15 years smokes daily; mean of all 11 countries, 16.6\%), but the US had the highest percentage of adults who were overweight or obese at 70.1\% (range for other countries, 23.8\%-63.4\%; mean of all 11 countries, 55.6\%). Life expectancy in the US was the lowest of the 11 countries at 78.8 years (range for other countries, 80.7-83.9 years; mean of all 11 countries, 81.7 years), and infant mortality was the highest (5.8 deaths per 1000 live births in the US; 3.6 per 1000 for all 11 countries). The US did not differ substantially from the other countries in physician workforce (2.6 physicians per 1000; 43\% primary care physicians), or nursing workforce (11.1 nurses per 1000). The US had comparable numbers of hospital beds (2.8 per 1000) but higher utilization of magnetic resonance imaging (118 per 1000) and computed tomography (245 per 1000) vs other countries. The US had similar rates of utilization (US discharges per 100 000 were 192 for acute myocardial infarction, 365 for pneumonia, 230 for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; procedures per 100 000 were 204 for hip replacement, 226 for knee replacement, and 79 for coronary artery bypass graft surgery). Administrative costs of care (activities relating to planning, regulating, and managing health systems and services) accounted for 8\% in the US vs a range of 1\% to 3\% in the other countries. For pharmaceutical costs, spending per capita was \$1443 in the US vs a range of \$466 to \$939 in other countries. Salaries of physicians and nurses were higher in the US; for example, generalist physicians salaries were \$218 173 in the US compared with a range of \$86 607 to \$154 126 in the other countries.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Conclusions and Relevance{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The United States spent approximately twice as much as other high-income countries on medical care, yet utilization rates in the United States were largely similar to those in other nations. Prices of labor and goods, including pharmaceuticals, and administrative costs appeared to be the major drivers of the difference in overall cost between the United States and other high-income countries. As patients, physicians, policy makers, and legislators actively debate the future of the US health system, data such as these are needed to inform policy decisions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials and observational studies assessing platelet (PLT) transfusion therapy identified gaps in the descriptions of trial design, variables of the PLT products transfused, and outcomes. We aimed to systematically develop a reporting guideline to aid in designing, reporting, and critiquing PLT trials. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: With the use of expert opinion, a preliminary checklist of 23 items was created. The Delphi method, an iterative forecasting method, was used to achieve consensus among experts to systematically improve upon the preliminary checklist. Items were ranked for inclusion using a 7?point Likert scale from ?definitely should not? to ?very important to? include. Criteria were established a priori based on the mean score: at least 5.5 accept, 2.6 to 5.4 intermediate, and not more than 2.5 eliminate. Intermediate items were edited and sent out in subsequent rounds for review. Three rounds were undertaken to determine the final checklist. RESULTS: Initially 33 experts participated, decreasing to 25 by the third round. The preliminary checklist consisted of 23 items spread over four sections: methods and intervention, PLT?specific outcomes, PLT?specific results, and PLT?specific adverse events. After three rounds of the Delphi method, the checklist was expanded and refined to include 30 items. The final checklist was further enhanced by adding an explanatory guide. CONCLUSION: Use of the Delphi method was successful in finding consensus on items to include in reports of a clinical PLT transfusion study. The final checklist and explanatory guide will be useful for authors and editors to improve the reporting of PLT transfusion trials.},

	abstract = {Introduction Reporting guidelines (e.g. CONSORT) have been developed as tools to improve quality and reduce bias in reporting research findings. Trial registration has been recommended for countering selective publication. The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) encourages the implementation of reporting guidelines and trial registration as uniform requirements (URM). For the last two decades, however, biased reporting and insufficient registration of clinical trials has been identified in several literature reviews and other investigations. No study has so far investigated the extent to which author instructions in psychiatry journals encourage following reporting guidelines and trial registration. Method Psychiatry Journals were identified from the 2011 Journal Citation Report. Information given in the author instructions and during the submission procedure of all journals was assessed on whether major reporting guidelines, trial registration and the ICMJE’s URM in general were mentioned and adherence recommended. Results We included 123 psychiatry journals (English and German language) in our analysis. A minority recommend or require 1) following the URM (21\%), 2) adherence to reporting guidelines such as CONSORT, PRISMA, STROBE (23\%, 7\%, 4\%), or 3) registration of clinical trials (34\%). The subsample of the top-10 psychiatry journals (ranked by impact factor) provided much better but still improvable rates. For example, 70\% of the top-10 psychiatry journals do not ask for the specific trial registration number. Discussion Under the assumption that better reported and better registered clinical research that does not lack substantial information will improve the understanding, credibility, and unbiased translation of clinical research findings, several stakeholders including readers (physicians, patients), authors, reviewers, and editors might benefit from improved author instructions in psychiatry journals. A first step of improvement would consist in requiring adherence to the broadly accepted reporting guidelines and to trial registration.},

	abstract = {Objective Given preliminary evidence for positive health outcomes related to contact with nature for cancer populations, research is warranted to ascertain possible strategies for incorporating nature-based care opportunities into oncology contexts as additional strategies for addressing multidimensional aspects of cancer patients’ health and recovery needs. The objective of this study was to consolidate existing research related to nature-based supportive care opportunities and generate a conceptual framework for discerning relevant applications in the supportive care setting.
Methods Drawing on research investigating nature-based engagement in oncology contexts, a two-step analytic process was used to construct a conceptual framework for guiding nature-based supportive care design and future research. Concept analysis methodology generated new representations of understanding by extracting and synthesising salient concepts. Newly formulated concepts were transposed to findings from related research about patient-reported and healthcare expert-developed recommendations for nature-based supportive care in oncology.
Results Five theoretical concepts (themes) were formulated describing patients’ reasons for engaging with nature and the underlying needs these interactions address. These included: connecting with what is genuinely valued, distancing from the cancer experience, meaning-making and reframing the cancer experience, finding comfort and safety, and vital nurturance. Eight shared patient and expert recommendations were compiled, which address the identified needs through nature-based initiatives. Eleven additional patient-reported recommendations attend to beneficial and adverse experiential qualities of patients’ nature-based engagement and complete the framework.
Conclusions The framework outlines salient findings about helpful nature-based supportive care opportunities for ready access by healthcare practitioners, designers, researchers and patients themselves.},

	abstract = {Much biomedical research is observational. The reporting of such research is often inadequate, which hampers the assessment of its strengths and weaknesses and of a study's generalizability. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Initiative developed recommendations on what should be included in an accurate and complete report of an observational study. We defined the scope of the recommendations to cover three main study designs: cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies. We convened a 2-day workshop in September 2004, with methodologists, researchers, and journal editors to draft a checklist of items. This list was subsequently revised during several meetings of the coordinating group and in e-mail discussions with the larger group of STROBE contributors, taking into account empirical evidence and methodological considerations. The workshop and the subsequent iterative process of consultation and revision resulted in a checklist of 22 items (the STROBE Statement) that relate to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of articles. 18 items are common to all three study designs and four are specific for cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional studies. A detailed Explanation and Elaboration document is published separately and is freely available on the web sites of PLoS Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine, and Epidemiology. We hope that the STROBE Statement will contribute to improving the quality of reporting of observational studies.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Reporting guidelines (RG) aim to improve research transparency and ensure high-quality study reporting. Similarly, clinical trial registration policies aim to reduce bias in results reporting by ensuring prospective registration of all trial outcomes. Failure to adhere to quality standards documented in RGs may result in low-quality and irreproducible research. Herein, we investigate the adherence to common RGs and trial registration policies in 21 oncology journals. We surveyed the Instructions for Authors page for each of the included oncology journals for adherence to common reporting guidelines and trial registration policies. We corresponded with editors to determine accepted study types and cross-referenced this information with a journal’s RGs and trial registration policies to calculate the per cent of journals that adhere to a specific guideline or policy. 76.2\% (16/21) of oncology journals surveyed adhere to Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines for clinical trials while only 33.3\% (7/21) adhere to Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology for observational studies. Similarly, 76.2\% (16/21) of oncology journals adhere to clinical trial registration policies. We further demonstrate that journal adherence to RGs positively affects author reporting, despite adherence to trial registration policies showing no such benefit. Our results show that oncology journals adhere to RGs and trial registration policies at a higher rate than other specialties, but nonetheless show room for improvement. We conclude that oncology journal adherence to RGs and trial registration policies is encouraging, but nonetheless suboptimal. We recommend the adoption of RGs and trial registration policies by all oncology journals.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Objective
To develop an evidence-based guideline for Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) for systematic reviews (SRs), health technology assessments, and other evidence syntheses.
Study Design and Setting
An SR, Web-based survey of experts, and consensus development forum were undertaken to identify checklists that evaluated or validated electronic literature search strategies and to determine which of their elements related to search quality or errors.
Results
Systematic review: No new search elements were identified for addition to the existing (2008–2010) PRESS 2015 Evidence-Based Checklist, and there was no evidence refuting any of its elements. Results suggested that structured PRESS could identify search errors and improve the selection of search terms. Web-based survey of experts: Most respondents felt that peer review should be undertaken after the MEDLINE search had been prepared but before it had been translated to other databases. Consensus development forum: Of the seven original PRESS elements, six were retained: translation of the research question; Boolean and proximity operators; subject headings; text word search; spelling, syntax and line numbers; and limits and filters. The seventh (skilled translation of the search strategy to additional databases) was removed, as there was consensus that this should be left to the discretion of searchers. An updated PRESS 2015 Guideline Statement was developed, which includes the following four documents: PRESS 2015 Evidence-Based Checklist, PRESS 2015 Recommendations for Librarian Practice, PRESS 2015 Implementation Strategies, and PRESS 2015 Guideline Assessment Form.
Conclusion
The PRESS 2015 Guideline Statement should help to guide and improve the peer review of electronic literature search strategies.},

	abstract = {Clinical trial investigators often record a great deal of baseline data on each patient at randomization. When reporting the trial's findings such baseline data can be used for (i) subgroup analyses which explore whether there is evidence that the treatment difference depends on certain patient characteristics, (ii) covariate-adjusted analyses which aim to refine the analysis of the overall treatment difference by taking account of the fact that some baseline characteristics are related to outcome and may be unbalanced between treatment groups, and (iii) baseline comparisons which compare the baseline characteristics of patients in each treatment group for any possible (unlucky) differences. This paper examines how these issues are currently tackled in the medical journals, based on a recent survey of 50 trial reports in four major journals. The statistical ramifications are explored, major problems are highlighted and recommendations for future practice are proposed. Key issues include: the overuse and overinterpretation of subgroup analyses; the underuse of appropriate statistical tests for interaction; inconsistencies in the use of covariate-adjustment; the lack of clear guidelines on covariate selection; the overuse of baseline comparisons in some studies; the misuses of significance tests for baseline comparability, and the need for trials to have a predefined statistical analysis plan for all these uses of baseline data.},

	abstract = {Introduction PRISMA statement was published in 2009 in order to set standards in the reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of PRISMA endorsement on the quality of reporting and methodological quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, published in journals in the field of gastroenterology and hepatology (GH). Methods Quality of reporting and methodological quality were evaluated by assessing the adherence of papers to PRISMA checklist and AMSTAR quality scale. After identifying the GH journals which endorsed PRISMA in instructions for authors (IA), we appraised: 15 papers published in 2012 explicitly mentioning PRISMA in the full text (Group A); 15 papers from the same journals published in 2012 not explicitly mentioning PRISMA in the full text (Group B); 30 papers published the year preceding PRISMA endorsement from the same journals as above (Group C); 30 papers published in 2012 on the 10 highest impact factor journals in GH which not endorsed PRISMA (Group D). Results PRISMA statement was referred in the IA in 9 out of 70 GH journals (12.9\%). We found significant increase in overall adherence to PRISMA checklist (Group A, 90.1\%; Group C, 83.1\%; p = 0.003) and compliance to AMSTAR scale (Group A, 85.0\%; Group C, 74.6\%; p = 0.002), following the PRISMA endorsement from the nine GH journals. Explicit referencing of PRISMA in manuscript was not associated with increase in quality of reporting and methodological quality (Group A vs. B, p = 0.651, p = 0.900, respectively). Adherence to PRISMA checklist, and the compliance with AMSTAR were significantly higher in journals endorsing PRISMA compared to those not (Groups A+B vs. D; p = 0.003 and p = 0.016, respectively). Conclusion The endorsement of PRISMA resulted in increase of both quality of reporting and methodological quality. It is advised that an increasing number of medical journals include PRISMA in the instructions for authors.},

	abstract = {{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Objective{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Systematic reviews (SRs) often poorly report key information, thereby diminishing their usefulness. Previous studies evaluated published SRs and determined that they failed to meet explicit criteria or characteristics. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement was recommended as a reporting guideline for SR and meta-analysis (MA), but previous studies showed that adherence to the statement was not high for SRs published in different medical fields. Thus, the aims of this study are twofold: (1) to investigate the number of nursing journals that have required or recommended the use of the PRISMA statement for reporting SR, and (2) to examine the adherence of SRs and/or meta-analyses to the PRISMA statement published in nursing journals.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Design{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}A cross-sectional study.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Nursing journals listed in the ISI journal citation report were divided into 2 groups based on the recommendation of PRISMA statement in their ‘Instruction for Authors’.

	abstract = {Objective
To evaluate whether fertility and top gynecology journals indexed in PubMed require the use of reporting guidelines and to identify the percentage of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in 2013 that were written following CONSORT guidelines in the top four fertility journals (by their highest impact factor).
Design
Cross-sectional study evaluating instructions for authors and RCTs published in fertility journals.
Setting
Academic institution.
Patient(s)
None.
Intervention(s)
None.
Main Outcome Measure(s)
Proportion of instruction-for-authors documents that suggested or required the use of reporting guidelines, and proportion of RCTs published in 2013 that accomplished the CONSORT checklist.
Result(s)
In 47\% (16/34) of the journals one or more reporting guidelines were mentioned in the instructions for authors' documents. PRISMA and CONSORT were the most commonly mentioned reporting guidelines. None of the analyzed RCTs completed the 25 items of CONSORT guideline. Sequence generation or allocation concealment was not described in 69\% of the studies. One-third of the journals did not publish a flowchart, 72\% did not show relative and absolute size-effect measures, and 42\% did not use measures of imprecision. In the summaries, 42\% did not discuss the limitations of the study and 78\% did not mention the generalizability of the results.
Conclusion(s)
Less than half of the analyzed peer-reviewed journals request the authors to use reporting guidelines. Nevertheless, among the top fertility and gynecology journals, reporting guidelines are widely mentioned. Overall, accomplishment of CONSORT items was suboptimal. Editorial boards, reviewers, and authors should join efforts to improve the quality of reporting.},

We aimed to determine the explicit citing of RGs (CONSORT, PRISMA, STROBE) in urogynecology articles in 2013, the requirements of relevant journals and a potential difference between urogynecology and general gynecology journals. Methods All urogynecologic articles published between January and December 2013 in the journals NAU, IUJ, FPMRS, GREEN, AJOG, and BJOG were included. Issues were searched for systematic reviews, RCTs, cohort studies, case-control studies and cross-sectional studies. Each electronic article was searched for the term PRISMA, CONSORT, or STROBE according to the study design. Instructions to Authors of the six journals were screened for requirement of using RGs. Results We included 296 articles (243 observational studies, 40 RCTs, and 13 systematic reviews). The use of PRISMA guidelines was explicitly declared in 54\% of systematic reviews, CONSORT guidelines were referenced in 25\% of RCTs and STROBE in 1.2\% of observational studies. The use of CONSORT is required by all journals except FPMRS. PRISMA and STROBE are only compulsory in the journals GREEN, AJOG, and BJOG. The overall rate of explicit mentioning of RGs comparing urogynecology and general gynecology journals was 6.7\% versus 7.1\%, respectively. Conclusions The explicit mentioning of RGs was on a relatively low level. A slightly higher adherence was recognized among general gynecology journals compared to urogynecology journals. Stronger efforts should be taken to further promote the use of RGs in urogynecology. Neurourol. Urodynam. 35:412–416, 2016. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Summary Background Reporting guidelines and trial/review registration policies have been instituted in order to minimize bias and improve research practices. Objective The objective of this study was to investigate the policies of hematology journals concerning reporting guideline adoption and trial/review registration. Methods We performed a web-based data abstraction from the Instructions for Authors of 67 hematology journals catalogued in the Expanded Science Citation Index of the 2014 Journal Citation Reports to identify whether each journal required, recommended or made no mention of the following reporting guidelines: EQUATOR, ICMJE, CONSORT, MOOSE, QUOROM, PRISMA, STARD, STROBE, ARRIVE and CARE. We also extracted whether journals required or recommended trial or systematic review registration. We e-mailed editors three times to determine which types of studies their journal accepts. Results Forty-eight per cent (32/67) of hematology journals do not adhere to any reporting guidelines. For responding journals, the QUOROM statement, MOOSE, CARE and PROSPERO were the least often mentioned, whereas the ICMJE guidelines, CONSORT statement and general trial registration were most often mentioned. Discussion Reporting guidelines are infrequently required or recommended by hematology journals. Furthermore, few require clinical trial or systematic review database registration. A higher rate of adherence to reporting guidelines can prevent bias from entering the literature. Participation from all stakeholders, including authors and journal editors, to improve reporting guideline and policy practices is required.},

	abstract = {Aims
Guidance has been published on how best to report randomised controlled trials (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials - CONSORT) and systematic reviews (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis - PRISMA). In 2011, we reported a low rate of enforcement by surgery journals for submitted manuscripts to conform to these guidelines. The aim of this follow-up study is to establish whether there has been any improvement.
Methods
We studied the 134 surgery journals indexed in the Journal Citation Report. The ‘Instructions to Authors’ were scrutinised for inclusion of the following guidance: CONSORT, PRISMA, clinical trial registration and systematic review registration.
Results
Compared to 2011, there has been an improvement in the endorsement of reporting guidance in journals' ‘Instructions to Authors’ in 2014, as follows: trial registration (42\% vs 33\%), CONSORT (42\% vs 30\%) and PRISMA (19\% vs 10\%, all p {\textless} 0.001). As in 2011, journals with a higher impact were more likely to adopt trial registration (p {\textless} 0.001), CONSORT (p {\textless} 0.001) and PRISMA (p = 0.002). Journals with editorial offices in the UK were more likely to endorse guidance compared to those outside the UK (p {\textless} 0.05). Only one journal mentioned registration for systematic reviews.
Conclusions
Surgery journals are presently more likely to require submitted manuscripts to follow published reporting guidance compared to three years ago. However, overall concordance rates are still low, and an improvement is required to help enhance the quality of reporting – and ultimately the conduct – of randomised control trials and systematic reviews in surgery.},

	abstract = {Several studies analyzed whether conventional journals in general medicine or specialties such as pediatrics endorse recommendations aiming to improve publication practice. Despite evidence showing benefits of these recommendations, the proportion of endorsing journals has been moderate to low and varied considerably for different recommendations. About half of pediatric journals indexed in the Journal Citation Report referred to the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) but only about a quarter recommended registration of trials. We aimed to investigate to what extent pediatric open-access (OA) journals endorse these recommendations. We hypothesized that a high proportion of these journals have adopted recommendations on good publication practice since OA electronic publishing has been associated with a number of editorial innovations aiming at improved access and transparency.},

Examining 25 in-depth interviews, we found that code saturation was reached at nine interviews, whereby the range of thematic issues was identified. However, 16 to 24 interviews were needed to reach meaning saturation where we developed a richly textured understanding of issues. Thus, code saturation may indicate when researchers have “heard it all,” but meaning saturation is needed to “understand it all.” We used our results to develop parameters that influence saturation, which may be used to estimate sample sizes for qualitative research proposals or to document in publications the grounds on which saturation was achieved.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe a novel CONsolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) adherence strategy implemented by the American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics (AJO-DO) and to report its impact on the completeness of reporting of published trials.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: The AJO-DO CONSORT adherence strategy, initiated in June 2011, involves active assessment of randomized clinical trial (RCT) reporting during the editorial process. The completeness of reporting CONSORT items was compared between trials submitted and published during the implementation period (July 2011 to September 2013) and trials published between August 2007 and July 2009.
RESULTS: Of the 42 RCTs submitted (July 2011 to September 2013), 23 were considered for publication and assessed for completeness of reporting, seven of which were eventually published. For all published RCTs between 2007 and 2009 (n = 20), completeness of reporting by CONSORT item ranged from 0\% to 100\% (Median = 40\%, interquartile range = 60\%). All published trials in 2011-2013, reported 33 of 37 CONSORT (sub) items. Four CONSORT 2010 checklist items remained problematic even after implementation of the adherence strategy: changes to methods (3b), changes to outcomes (6b) after the trial commenced, interim analysis (7b), and trial stopping (14b), which are typically only reported when applicable.
CONCLUSION: Trials published following implementation of the AJO-DO CONSORT adherence strategy completely reported more CONSORT items than those published or submitted previously.},

Recent years have seen a large increase in SEMs in the behavioral science literature, but consideration of sample size requirements for applied SEMs often relies on outdated rules-of-thumb. This study used Monte Carlo data simulation techniques to evaluate sample size requirements for common applied SEMs. Across a series of simulations, we systematically varied key model properties, including number of indicators and factors, magnitude of factor loadings and path coefficients, and amount of missing data. We investigated how changes in these parameters affected sample size requirements with respect to statistical power, bias in the parameter estimates, and overall solution propriety. Results revealed a range of sample size requirements (i.e., from 30 to 460 cases), meaningful patterns of association between parameters and sample size, and highlight the limitations of commonly cited rules-of-thumb. The broad “lessons learned” for determining SEM sample size requirements are discussed.},

This simulation study addressed minimum sample size requirements for 180 different population conditions that varied in the number of factors, the number of variables per factor, and the level of communality. Congruence coefficients were calculated to assess the agreement between population solutions and sample solutions generated from the various population conditions. Although absolute minimums are not presented, it was found that, in general, minimum sample sizes appear to be smaller for higher levels of communality; minimum sample sizes appear to be smaller for higher ratios of the number of variables to the number of factors; and when the variables-to-factors ratio exceeds 6, the minimum sample size begins to stabilize regardless of the number of factors or the level of communality.},

Purpose: In this article, we share strategies to enhance research publication contents (ie, what to write about) and to facilitate scientific writing (ie, how to write) in health research collaborations. Methods: Empirical experience sharing. Results: To enhance research publication contents, we encourage identifying appropriate opportunities for publications, publishing protocols ahead of results papers, seeking publications related to methodological issues, considering justified secondary analyses, and sharing academic process or experience. To advance writing, we suggest setting up scientific writing as a goal, seeking an appropriate mentorship, making full use of scientific meetings and presentations, taking some necessary formal training in areas such as effective communication and time and stress management, and embracing the iterative process of writing. Conclusion: All the strategies we share are dependent upon each other; and they advocate gradual academic accomplishments through study and training in a \&ldquo;success-breeds-success\&rdquo; way. It is expected that the foregoing shared strategies in this paper, together with other previous guidance articles, can assist one with enhancing research publications, and eventually one\&rsquo;s academic success in health research collaborations.

	abstract = {Background: Management strategies for patients with chronic conditions are becoming increasingly complex, which may result in a burden of treatment for patients. To develop a Minimally Disruptive Medicine designed to reduce the burden of treatment, clinicians need to understand which healthcare tasks and aggravating factors may be responsible for this burden. The objective of the present study was to describe and classify the components of the burden of treatment for patients with chronic conditions from the patient’s perspective.
Methods: We performed a multi-country qualitative study using an online survey and a purposive sampling strategy to select English-, French-, and Spanish-speaking participants with different chronic conditions. Participants were recruited by physicians, patients’ associations, advertisement on social media, and ‘snowballing’. The answers were analyzed by i) manual content analysis with a grounded theory approach, coded by two researchers, and ii) automatic textual analysis by Reinert’s method.
Results: Between 2013 and 2014, 1,053 participants from 34 different countries completed the online survey using 408,625 words. Results from both analyses were synthesized in a taxonomy of the burden of treatment, which described i) the tasks imposed on patients by their diseases and by their healthcare system (e.g., medication management, lifestyle changes, follow-up, etc.); ii) the structural (e.g., access to healthcare resources, coordination between care providers), personal, situational, and financial factors that aggravated the burden of treatment; and iii) patient-reported consequences of the burden (e.g., poor adherence to treatments, financial burden, impact on professional, family, and social life, etc.). Our findings may not be applicable to patients with chronic conditions who differ from those who responded to our survey.
Conclusions: Our taxonomy of the burden of treatment, provided by patients with chronic conditions from different countries and settings, supports the development of tools to ascertain the burden of treatment and highlights potential targets for interventions to minimize it.},

	abstract = {Objective
Complex and highly sensitive electronic literature search strategies are required for systematic reviews; however, no guidelines exist for their peer review. Poor searches may fail to identify existing evidence because of inadequate recall (sensitivity) or increase the resource requirements of reviews as a result of inadequate precision. Our objective was to create an annotated checklist for electronic search strategy peer review.
Study Design
A systematic review of the library and information retrieval literature for important elements in electronic search strategies was conducted, along with a survey of individuals experienced in systematic review searching.
Results
Six elements with a strong consensus as to their importance in peer review were accurate translation of the research question into search concepts, correct choice of Boolean operators and of line numbers, adequate translation of the search strategy for each database, inclusion of relevant subject headings, and absence of spelling errors. Seven additional elements had partial support and are included in this guideline.
Conclusion
This evidence-based guideline facilitates the improvement of search quality through peer review, and thus the improvement in quality of systematic reviews. It is relevant for librarians/information specialists, journal editors, developers of knowledge translation tools, research organizations, and funding bodies.},

	abstract = {Binary logistic regression is one of the most frequently applied statistical approaches for developing clinical prediction models. Developers of such models often rely on an Events Per Variable criterion (EPV), notably EPV ≥10, to determine the minimal sample size required and the maximum number of candidate predictors that can be examined. We present an extensive simulation study in which we studied the influence of EPV, events fraction, number of candidate predictors, the correlations and distributions of candidate predictor variables, area under the ROC curve, and predictor effects on out-of-sample predictive performance of prediction models. The out-of-sample performance (calibration, discrimination and probability prediction error) of developed prediction models was studied before and after regression shrinkage and variable selection. The results indicate that EPV does not have a strong relation with metrics of predictive performance, and is not an appropriate criterion for (binary) prediction model development studies. We show that out-of-sample predictive performance can better be approximated by considering the number of predictors, the total sample size and the events fraction. We propose that the development of new sample size criteria for prediction models should be based on these three parameters, and provide suggestions for improving sample size determination.},

	abstract = {Objective: To provide medical kit recommendations for short mountain wilderness recreation trips (hiking, trekking, backpacking, mountaineering etc.) based on the epidemiology of injury and illness sustained and best treatment guidelines. Additionally, to compare these recommendations to the medical kit contents of mountain climbers in Colorado.Methods: A primary literature review concerning the epidemiology of injury and illness in mountain wilderness settings was performed. This information and literature on the efficacy of given treatments were used to derive recommendations for an evidence-based medical kit. The contents of 158 medical kits and the most likely demographics to carry them were compiled from surveys obtained from mountain climbers on 11 of Colorado’s 14 000-foot peaks.Results: Musculoskeletal trauma, strains, sprains and skin wounds were the most common medical issues reported in the 11 studies, which met inclusion criteria. Adhesive bandages (Band-Aids) were the most common item and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were the most common medication carried in medical kits in Colorado. More than 100 distinct items were reported overall.Conclusion: Mountain climbing epidemiology and current clinical guidelines suggest that a basic mountain medical kit should include items for body substance isolation, materials for immobilization, pain medications, wound care supplies, and medications for gastrointestinal upset and flu-like illness. The medical kits of Colorado mountain climbers varied considerable and often lacked essential items such as medical gloves. This suggests a need for increased guidance. Similar methodology could be used to inform medical kits for other outdoor activities, mountain rescue personnel, and travel to areas with limited formal medical care.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate observational research manuscripts submitted to Obstetrics \& Gynecology to determine the level of adherence to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist and highlight specific areas that could be improved.
METHODS: A scoring system based on the STROBE checklist was developed and validated for consistency by volunteer medical students or doctors. Using this scoring system, we performed a cross-sectional analysis on 198 observational research manuscripts submitted to Obstetrics \& Gynecology from 2008 to 2016. Each manuscript was given a score based on the STROBE checklist. Comparisons were made among acceptance status, country of origin, and study type. Descriptive statistics (means, medians, and frequencies) were calculated for each manuscript category. The t test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare differences between two groups and analysis of variance or the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare differences among three or more groups.
RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between the mean score for accepted (23.2±2.7) compared with rejected (19.7±4.1) manuscripts (P{\textless}.001). This difference was not seen when comparing country of origin and study type. Poor reporting was seen among all manuscript categories for objectives, study size, missing data, study participants, and translation of risk. Additionally, rejected manuscripts had poor reporting for eligibility criteria, variables, bias and confounding, statistical methods, unadjusted and adjusted estimates, and category boundaries.
CONCLUSION: Overall, accepted manuscripts show better adherence to the STROBE checklist, but there are several critical items that are poorly reported in all manuscripts.},

	abstract = {Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are increasingly popular in the social sciences, not only in medicine. We argue that the lay public, and sometimes researchers, put too much trust in RCTs over other methods of investigation. Contrary to frequent claims in the applied literature, randomization does not equalize everything other than the treatment in the treatment and control groups, it does not automatically deliver a precise estimate of the average treatment effect (ATE), and it does not relieve us of the need to think about (observed or unobserved) covariates. Finding out whether an estimate was generated by chance is more difficult than commonly believed. At best, an RCT yields an unbiased estimate, but this property is of limited practical value. Even then, estimates apply only to the sample selected for the trial, often no more than a convenience sample, and justification is required to extend the results to other groups, including any population to which the trial sample belongs, or to any individual, including an individual in the trial. Demanding ‘external validity’ is unhelpful because it expects too much of an RCT while undervaluing its potential contribution. RCTs do indeed require minimal assumptions and can operate with little prior knowledge. This is an advantage when persuading distrustful audiences, but it is a disadvantage for cumulative scientific progress, where prior knowledge should be built upon, not discarded. RCTs can play a role in building scientific knowledge and useful predictions but they can only do so as part of a cumulative program, combining with other methods, including conceptual and theoretical development, to discover not ‘what works’, but ‘why things work’.},

	abstract = {This report investigates the meaning and (potential) impact of the FAIR data principles in practice. These principles were established by a group of diverse stakeholders engaging via a working group in FORCE11. They are referenced in many policy documents and in developments of open science, for example, the European Open Science Cloud.  This report explored FAIR with stakeholders in the UK academic research community. Its aims were to understand how using or being inspired by these principles improves the findability, accessibility, interoperability and reuse of research data, including consideration of disciplinary differences. Jisc established a group of research data experts and Jisc staff who provided expertise and helped to validate findings. Interviews and focus groups were conducted, primarily with researchers, but also involving input from research support professionals, publishers and funders. An assessment of the use of FAIR principles in institutional research data management (RDM) guidance was also carried out. Data collected from these activities was synthesised and structured using a PEST framework - grouped into factors relating to Political, Economic, Social and Technical aspects. Explicit use of FAIR was seen to be limited, in many cases, to discussion at a fairly conceptual level amongst those most heavily involved in best practice of data management. Even where FAIR was fairly well established as a term and a concept, it tended to largely reflect existing practice. Arguably this was without significantly influencing many practical changes for those at the “leading edge” of data management, although it did provide a new and effective common way of communicating best practice. However, in exploring the underlying practices of research, demonstrating findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability, there was considerable evidence that good practice existed in all of these elements. In many cases this was both well established (over many years) and continually improving.},

	abstract = {Background The pathway from evidence generation to consumption contains many steps which can lead to overstatement or misinformation. The proliferation of internet-based health news may encourage selection of media and academic research articles that overstate strength of causal inference. We investigated the state of causal inference in health research as it appears at the end of the pathway, at the point of social media consumption. Methods We screened the NewsWhip Insights database for the most shared media articles on Facebook and Twitter reporting about peer-reviewed academic studies associating an exposure with a health outcome in 2015, extracting the 50 most-shared academic articles and media articles covering them. We designed and utilized a review tool to systematically assess and summarize studies’ strength of causal inference, including generalizability, potential confounders, and methods used. These were then compared with the strength of causal language used to describe results in both academic and media articles. Two randomly assigned independent reviewers and one arbitrating reviewer from a pool of 21 reviewers assessed each article. Results We accepted the most shared 64 media articles pertaining to 50 academic articles for review, representing 68\% of Facebook and 45\% of Twitter shares in 2015. Thirty-four percent of academic studies and 48\% of media articles used language that reviewers considered too strong for their strength of causal inference. Seventy percent of academic studies were considered low or very low strength of inference, with only 6\% considered high or very high strength of causal inference. The most severe issues with academic studies’ causal inference were reported to be omitted confounding variables and generalizability. Fifty-eight percent of media articles were found to have inaccurately reported the question, results, intervention, or population of the academic study. Conclusions We find a large disparity between the strength of language as presented to the research consumer and the underlying strength of causal inference among the studies most widely shared on social media. However, because this sample was designed to be representative of the articles selected and shared on social media, it is unlikely to be representative of all academic and media work. More research is needed to determine how academic institutions, media organizations, and social network sharing patterns impact causal inference and language as received by the research consumer.},

At the same time, limitations inherent in using data collected without specific a priori research questions are increasingly recognized. There is also a growing awareness of the suboptimal quality of reports presenting research based on RCD. This has created a perfect storm of increased interest and use of RCD for research, together with inadequate reporting of the strengths and weaknesses of these data resources. The REporting of studies Conducted using Observational Routinely-collected Data (RECORD) statement was developed to address these limitations and to help researchers using RCD to meet their ethical obligations of complete and accurate reporting, as well as improve the utility of research conducted using RCD. The RECORD statement has been endorsed by more than 15 journals, including Clinical Epidemiology. This journal now recommends that authors submit the RECORD checklist together with any manuscript reporting on research using RCD.},

The model consists first of a decision making core (goal desire → goal intention → action desire → action intention) that is grounded in basic decision making variables/processes of a universal nature. The decision core also contains a mechanism for self-regulation that moderates the effects of desires on intentions. Second, added to the decision making core are a number of causes and effects of decisions and self-regulatory reasoning, with the aim of introducing potential contingent, contextual nuances for understanding decision making. Many of the causal variables here are contained within TAM or its extensions; also considered are new variables grounded in emotional, group/social/cultural, and goal-directed behavior research.},

In describing the design of MTutor pedagogic issues of problem-based learning, situated cognition and ill-structured problems are discussed. MTutor presents teachers with complex real-life teaching problems, which they are required to solve online through collaboration with other teachers. In order to explore the influence of this online learning experience on the identity and practice of teachers, we present the results from a small-scale study in which six students were interviewed about their online experiences. We conclude that, within the sample, students’ engagement with online problem-based learning within their community of practice positively influenced their professional practice styles, but that there is little evidence to suggest that online identity influences real-life practice.DOI: 10.1080/09687760500104088},

Among many other distinguishing features, lecture capture system (LCS) is the one which is being offered to enhance the ﬂexibility of learning environment for attracting executive business students. Majority of foreign universities are offering the facility of LCS to their students in offshore campuses established in Malaysia. Yet, very little is known about perception and behaviour of executive business students towards acceptance and use of this facility. Therefore, to bridge the identiﬁed gap in academic literature, this study is an effort to explore the causal relationship between existing constructs of extended uniﬁed theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2), personal innovativeness (PI), intention and use behaviour (UB) towards LCS. Moreover, this study is aimed to extend the UTAUT2 by introducing a new variable, namely, PI in the domain of information technology (IT) (PIIT).},

hypothesized to moderate the effects of these constructs on behavioral intention and technology use. Results
from a two-stage online survey, with technology use data collected four months after the first survey, of 1,512

	abstract = {Background
The Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services, or PARIHS framework, was first published in 1998. Since this time, work has been ongoing to further develop, refine and test it. Widely used as an organising or conceptual framework to help both explain and predict why the implementation of evidence into practice is or is not successful, PARIHS was one of the first frameworks to make explicit the multi-dimensional and complex nature of implementation as well as highlighting the central importance of context. Several critiques of the framework have also pointed out its limitations and suggested areas for improvement.

Discussion
Building on the published critiques and a number of empirical studies, this paper introduces a revised version of the framework, called the integrated or i-PARIHS framework. The theoretical antecedents of the framework are described as well as outlining the revised and new elements, notably, the revision of how evidence is described; how the individual and teams are incorporated; and how context is further delineated. We describe how the framework can be operationalised and draw on case study data to demonstrate the preliminary testing of the face and content validity of the revised framework.

Summary
This paper is presented for deliberation and discussion within the implementation science community. Responding to a series of critiques and helpful feedback on the utility of the original PARIHS framework, we seek feedback on the proposed improvements to the framework. We believe that the i-PARIHS framework creates a more integrated approach to understand the theoretical complexity from which implementation science draws its propositions and working hypotheses; that the new framework is more coherent and comprehensive and at the same time maintains it intuitive appeal; and that the models of facilitation described enable its more effective operationalisation.

The standard methods that are available to assess interaction, effect modification and mediation are explained and exemplified. For each concept, we first give a simple “best-case” example from a randomized controlled trial, followed by a structurally similar example from an observational study using research databases. Our explanation of the examples is based on recent theoretical developments and insights in the context of large health care databases. Terminology is sometimes ambiguous for what constitutes effect modification and interaction. The strong assumptions underlying the assessment of interaction, and particularly mediation, require clinicians and epidemiologists to take extra care when conducting observational studies in the context of health care databases. These strong assumptions may limit the applicability of interaction and mediation assessments, at least until the biases and limitations of these assessments when using large research databases are clarified.},

	abstract = {Objective
Correspondence Analysis (CA) is a multivariate graphical technique designed to explore relationships among categorical variables. Epidemiologists frequently collect data on multiple categorical variables with to the goal of examining associations amongst these variables. Nevertheless, despite its usefulness in this context, CA appears to be an underused technique in epidemiology. The objective of this paper is to present the utility of CA in an epidemiological context.

Study Design and Setting
The theory and interpretation of CA in the case of two variables and more than two variables is illustrated through two examples.

Results
The outcome from correspondence analysis is a graphical display of the rows and columns of a contingency table that is designed to permit visualization of the salient relationships among the variable responses in a low-dimensional space. Such a representation reveals a more global picture of the relationships among row-column pairs which would otherwise not be detected through a pairwise analysis.

Conclusion
When the study variables of interest are categorical, CA is an appropriate technique to explore relationships amongst variable response categories and can play a complementary role in analyzing epidemiological data.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Reporting guidelines (eg, Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials [CONSORT] statement) are intended to improve reporting standards and enhance the transparency and reproducibility of research findings. Despite accessibility of such guidelines, researchers are not required to adhere to them. Our goal was to determine the current status of reporting quality in the medical literature and examine whether adherence of reporting guidelines has improved since the inception of reporting guidelines.

Materials and methods
Eight reporting guidelines, such as CONSORT, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE), Quality of Reporting of Meta-analysis (QUOROM), STAndards for Reporting of Diagnostic accuracy (STARD), Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE), Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS), and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) were examined. Our inclusion criteria included reviews published between January 1996 to September 2016 which investigated the adherence to reporting guidelines in the literature that addressed clinical trials, systematic reviews, observational studies, meta-analysis, diagnostic accuracy, economic evaluations, and preclinical animal studies that were in English. All reviews were found on Web of Science, Excerpta Medical Database (EMBASE), MEDLINE, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL).

Results
Among the general searching of 26,819 studies by using the designed searching method, 124 studies were included post screening. We found that 87.9\% of the included studies reported suboptimal adherence to reporting guidelines. Factors associated with poor adherence included non-pharmacological interventions, year of publication, and trials concluding with significant results. Improved adherence was associated with better study designs such as allocation concealment, random sequence, large sample sizes, adequately powered studies, multiple authorships, and being published in journals endorsing guidelines.

Conclusion
We conclude that the level of adherence to reporting guidelines remains suboptimal. Endorsement of reporting guidelines by journals is important and recommended.},

	abstract = {Objective To explore how the results from the 2014 dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) trial were disseminated to the scientific community and online media.
Design A a systematic review of scholarly and public attention surrounding the DAPT study.
Settings Data were collected from the ISI Web of Knowledge, Google Scholar, PubMed Commons, EurekAlert, the DAPT study website (www.daptstudy.org) and the New England Journal of Medicine website (for scholarly attention) and Altmetric Explorer, Snap Bird, YouTube (for public attention) citing DAPT study results appearing from 16 November 2014 to 10 June 2015.
Participants No participants were involved in this study.
Main outcome measure Proportion of contents highlighting the increased risk of mortality and critical to the author’s interpretation of the results.
Results We identified 425 items reported by seven sources; 164 (39\%) disseminated the authors’ interpretation via an electronic link or a reference, with no additional text. Among 81 items (19 \%), the message favoured prolonged treatment and consequently overstated the article conclusions. Among 119 items (28 \%), the text was uncertain about the benefit of prolonged treatment but was reported with no or inappropriate mention of increased risk of mortality. Only 34 items (8 \%) were uncertain about the benefit of prolonged treatment and mentioned increased risk of mortality. In all, 27 items (6 \%) did not favour prolonged treatment, and only 12 of these (3 \%) clearly raised some concerns about the reporting of increased risk of death.
Conclusion Dissemination of the DAPT study results to the scientific community and on different media sources rarely criticised the interpretation of the study results.},

	abstract = {Objectives To identify and understand, through data from multiple sources, some of the factors that affect authors’ and editors’ decisions to use reporting guidelines in the publication of health research. Design Mixed methods study comprising an online survey and semi-structured interviews with a sample of authors (online survey: n = 56; response rate = 32\%; semi-structured interviews: n = 5) and journal editors (online survey: n = 43; response rate = 27\%; semi-structured interviews: n = 6) involved in publishing health and medical research. Participants were recruited from an earlier study examining the effectiveness of the TREND reporting guideline. Results Four types of factors interacted to affect authors’ and editors’ likelihood of reporting guideline use; individual (e.g. having multiple reasons for use of reporting guidelines); the professional culture in which people work; environmental (e.g. policies of journals); and, practical (e.g. having time to use reporting guidelines). Having multiple reasons for using reporting guidelines was a particularly salient factor in facilitating reporting guidelines use for both groups of participants. Conclusions Improving the completeness and consistency of reporting of research studies is critical to the integrity and synthesis of health research. The use of reporting guidelines offers one potentially efficient and effective means for achieving this, but decisions to use (or not use) reporting guidelines take many factors into account. These findings could be used to inform future studies that might, for example, test the factors that we have identified within a wider theoretical framework for understanding changes in professional practices. The use of reporting guidelines by senior professionals appears to shape the expectations of what constitutes best practice and can be assimilated into the culture of a field or discipline. Without evidence of effectiveness of reporting guidelines, and sustained, multifaceted efforts to improve reporting, little progress seems likely to be made.},

Reporting guidelines are a relatively recent development to help improve the accuracy, clarity, and transparency of biomedical publications. They have caught on, with hundreds of reporting guidelines now available. Some journals endorse reporting guidelines while a smaller number have used various approaches to implement them. Yet challenges remain – biomedical research is still not optimally reported despite the abundance of reporting guidelines. Electronic algorithms are now being developed to facilitate the choice of correct reporting guideline(s), while other tools are being integrated into journal editorial management processes. Universities need to consider whether it is responsible to advance careers of faculty based on poorly reported research which is of little societal value.

	volume = {21},
	issn = {1873-7862},
	doi = {10.1016/j.euroneuro.2011.08.008},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The spectrum of disorders of the brain is large, covering hundreds of disorders that are listed in either the mental or neurological disorder chapters of the established international diagnostic classification systems. These disorders have a high prevalence as well as short- and long-term impairments and disabilities. Therefore they are an emotional, financial and social burden to the patients, their families and their social network. In a 2005 landmark study, we estimated for the first time the annual cost of 12 major groups of disorders of the brain in Europe and gave a conservative estimate of €386 billion for the year 2004. This estimate was limited in scope and conservative due to the lack of sufficiently comprehensive epidemiological and/or economic data on several important diagnostic groups. We are now in a position to substantially improve and revise the 2004 estimates. In the present report we cover 19 major groups of disorders, 7 more than previously, of an increased range of age groups and more cost items. We therefore present much improved cost estimates. Our revised estimates also now include the new EU member states, and hence a population of 514 million people.
AIMS: To estimate the number of persons with defined disorders of the brain in Europe in 2010, the total cost per person related to each disease in terms of direct and indirect costs, and an estimate of the total cost per disorder and country.
METHODS: The best available estimates of the prevalence and cost per person for 19 groups of disorders of the brain (covering well over 100 specific disorders) were identified via a systematic review of the published literature. Together with the twelve disorders included in 2004, the following range of mental and neurologic groups of disorders is covered: addictive disorders, affective disorders, anxiety disorders, brain tumor, childhood and adolescent disorders (developmental disorders), dementia, eating disorders, epilepsy, mental retardation, migraine, multiple sclerosis, neuromuscular disorders, Parkinson's disease, personality disorders, psychotic disorders, sleep disorders, somatoform disorders, stroke, and traumatic brain injury. Epidemiologic panels were charged to complete the literature review for each disorder in order to estimate the 12-month prevalence, and health economic panels were charged to estimate best cost-estimates. A cost model was developed to combine the epidemiologic and economic data and estimate the total cost of each disorder in each of 30 European countries (EU27+Iceland, Norway and Switzerland). The cost model was populated with national statistics from Eurostat to adjust all costs to 2010 values, converting all local currencies to Euro, imputing costs for countries where no data were available, and aggregating country estimates to purchasing power parity adjusted estimates for the total cost of disorders of the brain in Europe 2010.
RESULTS: The total cost of disorders of the brain was estimated at €798 billion in 2010. Direct costs constitute the majority of costs (37\% direct healthcare costs and 23\% direct non-medical costs) whereas the remaining 40\% were indirect costs associated with patients' production losses. On average, the estimated cost per person with a disorder of the brain in Europe ranged between €285 for headache and €30,000 for neuromuscular disorders. The European per capita cost of disorders of the brain was €1550 on average but varied by country. The cost (in billion €PPP 2010) of the disorders of the brain included in this study was as follows: addiction: €65.7; anxiety disorders: €74.4; brain tumor: €5.2; child/adolescent disorders: €21.3; dementia: €105.2; eating disorders: €0.8; epilepsy: €13.8; headache: €43.5; mental retardation: €43.3; mood disorders: €113.4; multiple sclerosis: €14.6; neuromuscular disorders: €7.7; Parkinson's disease: €13.9; personality disorders: €27.3; psychotic disorders: €93.9; sleep disorders: €35.4; somatoform disorder: €21.2; stroke: €64.1; traumatic brain injury: €33.0. It should be noted that the revised estimate of those disorders included in the previous 2004 report constituted €477 billion, by and large confirming our previous study results after considering the inflation and population increase since 2004. Further, our results were consistent with administrative data on the health care expenditure in Europe, and comparable to previous studies on the cost of specific disorders in Europe. Our estimates were lower than comparable estimates from the US.
DISCUSSION: This study was based on the best currently available data in Europe and our model enabled extrapolation to countries where no data could be found. Still, the scarcity of data is an important source of uncertainty in our estimates and may imply over- or underestimations in some disorders and countries. Even though this review included many disorders, diagnoses, age groups and cost items that were omitted in 2004, there are still remaining disorders that could not be included due to limitations in the available data. We therefore consider our estimate of the total cost of the disorders of the brain in Europe to be conservative. In terms of the health economic burden outlined in this report, disorders of the brain likely constitute the number one economic challenge for European health care, now and in the future. Data presented in this report should be considered by all stakeholder groups, including policy makers, industry and patient advocacy groups, to reconsider the current science, research and public health agenda and define a coordinated plan of action of various levels to address the associated challenges.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Political action is required in light of the present high cost of disorders of the brain. Funding of brain research must be increased; care for patients with brain disorders as well as teaching at medical schools and other health related educations must be quantitatively and qualitatively improved, including psychological treatments. The current move of the pharmaceutical industry away from brain related indications must be halted and reversed. Continued research into the cost of the many disorders not included in the present study is warranted. It is essential that not only the EU but also the national governments forcefully support these initiatives.},

Tests divisible into distinct subtests should be so divided before using the formula. The index\$\${\textbackslash}bar r\_\{ij\} \$\$, derived from α, is shown to be an index of inter-item homogeneity. Comparison is made to the Guttman and Loevinger approaches. Parallel split coefficients are shown to be unnecessary for tests of common types. In designing tests, maximum interpretability of scores is obtained by increasing the first-factor concentration in any separately-scored subtest and avoiding substantial group-factor clusters within a subtest. Scalability is not a requisite.},

Using a 2‐index presentation strategy, which includes using the maximum likelihood (ML)‐based standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR) and supplementing it with either Tucker‐Lewis Index (TLI), Bollen's (1989) Fit Index (BL89), Relative Noncentrality Index (RNI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Gamma Hat, McDonald's Centrality Index (Mc), or root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA), various combinations of cutoff values from selected ranges of cutoff criteria for the ML‐based SRMR and a given supplemental fit index were used to calculate rejection rates for various types of true‐population and misspecified models; that is, models with misspecified factor covariance(s) and models with misspecified factor loading(s). The results suggest that, for the ML method, a cutoff value close to .95 for TLI, BL89, CFI, RNI, and Gamma Hat; a cutoff value close to .90 for Mc; a cutoff value close to .08 for SRMR; and a cutoff value close to .06 for RMSEA are needed before we can conclude that there is a relatively good fit between the hypothesized model and the observed data. Furthermore, the 2‐index presentation strategy is required to reject reasonable proportions of various types of true‐population and misspecified models. Finally, using the proposed cutoff criteria, the ML‐based TLI, Mc, and RMSEA tend to overreject true‐population models at small sample size and thus are less preferable when sample size is small.},

The Psychosocial Assessment Tool (PAT) has been used in other pediatric conditions. The current study explored the reliability and validity of the PAT (modified for use within the DSD population; PAT-DSD). \textbf{\textit{Methods:}} Participants were 197 families enrolled in the DSD-Translational Research Network (DSD-TRN) who completed a PAT-DSD during a DSD clinic visit. Psychosocial data were extracted from the DSD-TRN clinical registry. Internal reliability of the PAT-DSD was tested using the Kuder-Richardson-20 coefficient. Validity was examined by exploring the correlation of the PAT-DSD with other measures of caregiver distress and child emotional-behavioral functioning. \textbf{\textit{Results:}} One-third of families demonstrated psychosocial risk (27.9\% “Targeted” and 6.1\% “Clinical” level of risk). Internal reliability of the PAT-DSD Total score was high (α = 0.86); 4 of 8 subscales met acceptable internal reliability. A priori predicted relationships between the PAT-DSD and other psychosocial measures were supported. The PAT-DSD Total score related to measures of caregiver distress (\textit{r} = 0.40, \textit{p} \&\#x3c; 0.001) and to both caregiver-reported and patient self-reported behavioral problems (\textit{r} = 0.61, \textit{p} \&\#x3c; 0.00; \textit{r} = 0.37, \textit{p} \&\#x3c; 0.05). \textbf{\textit{Conclusions:}} This study provides evidence for the reliability and validity of the PAT-DSD.

Design Scoping review.
Search strategy We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases and conducted a grey literature search for (1) studies evaluating interventions to improve adherence to reporting guidelines in health research and (2) other types of references describing interventions that have been performed or suggested but never evaluated. The characteristics and effect of the evaluated interventions were analysed. Moreover, we explored the rationale of the interventions identified and determined the existing gaps in research on the evaluation of interventions to improve adherence to reporting guidelines.
Results 109 references containing 31 interventions (11 evaluated) were included. These were grouped into five categories: (1) training on the use of reporting guidelines, (2) improving understanding, (3) encouraging adherence, (4) checking adherence and providing feedback, and (5) involvement of experts. Additionally, we identified lack of evaluated interventions (1) on training on the use of reporting guidelines and improving their understanding, (2) at early stages of research and (3) after the final acceptance of the manuscript.
Conclusions This scoping review identified a wide range of strategies to improve adherence to reporting guidelines that can be taken by different stakeholders. Additional research is needed to assess the effectiveness of many of these interventions.},

Overwhelming evidence shows the quality of reporting of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is not optimal. Without transparent reporting, readers cannot judge the reliability and validity of trial findings nor extract information for systematic reviews. Recent methodological analyses indicate that inadequate reporting and design are associated with biased estimates of treatment effects. Such systematic error is seriously damaging to RCTs, which are considered the gold standard for evaluating interventions because of their ability to minimise or avoid bias.

A group of scientists and editors developed the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement to improve the quality of reporting of RCTs. It was first published in 1996 and updated in 2001. The statement consists of a checklist and flow diagram that authors can use for reporting an RCT. Many leading medical journals and major international editorial groups have endorsed the CONSORT statement. The statement facilitates critical appraisal and interpretation of RCTs.

During the 2001 CONSORT revision, it became clear that explanation and elaboration of the principles underlying the CONSORT statement would help investigators and others to write or appraise trial reports. A CONSORT explanation and elaboration article was published in 2001 alongside the 2001 version of the CONSORT statement.

After an expert meeting in January 2007, the CONSORT statement has been further revised and is published as the CONSORT 2010 Statement. This update improves the wording and clarity of the previous checklist and incorporates recommendations related to topics that have only recently received recognition, such as selective outcome reporting bias.

This explanatory and elaboration document—intended to enhance the use, understanding, and dissemination of the CONSORT statement—has also been extensively revised. It presents the meaning and rationale for each new and updated checklist item providing examples of good reporting and, where possible, references to relevant empirical studies. Several examples of flow diagrams …},

Yet an important thread in the academic literature acknowledges that medicine can also be responsible for perpetuating violence, albeit unintentionally, against the very individuals it intends to help. In this essay, I discuss definitions of violence, emphasizing the importance of understanding the term not only as a physical perpetration but as an act of power of one person over another. I next explore the paradox of a healing profession that is permeated with violence sometimes necessary, often unintentional, and almost always unrecognized. Identifying the construct of “physician arrogance” as contributory to violence, I go on to identify different manifestations of violence in a medical context, including violence to the body; structural violence; metaphoric violence; and the practice of speaking to or about patients (and others in the healthcare system in ways that minimize or disrespect their full humanity. I further suggest possible explanations for the origins of these kinds of violence in physicians, including the fear of suffering and death in relation to vicarious trauma and the consequent concept of “killing suffering”; as well as why patients might be willing to accept such violence directed toward them. I conclude with brief recommendations for attending to root causes of violence, both within societal and institutional structures, and within ourselves, offering the model of the wounded healer.},

Summary data on the characteristics, reporting quality, and methodological conduct of the studies included in the systematic reviews were extracted independently by two reviewers. The protocol was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (CRD42017059834).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Results{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Fifty-four systematic reviews were included, representing 11 health care fields, 26 health conditions, and 2008 mediation studies.

Those interventions slightly improved the items reported on the Manuscript Quality Assessment Instrument (MQAI), which assesses the quality of the research report. However, masked evaluators were able to guess the allocated group in 62\% (56/90) of the papers, thus presenting a risk of detection bias. In this post-hoc study, we analyse whether those interventions that were originally designed for improving the completeness of manuscript reporting may have had an effect on the number of citations, which is the measured outcome that we used.},

	title = {Importance of observational studies in clinical practice},
	volume = {29 Spec No},
	issn = {0149-2918},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In this era of evidence-based medicine, clinicians require a comprehensive range of well-designed studies to support prescribing decisions and patient management. In recent years, data from observational studies have become an increasingly important source of evidence because of improvements in observational-study methods and advances in statistical analysis.
OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the current literature and reports some of the key studies indicating that observational studies can both complement and build on the evidence base established by randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
METHODS: A literature search using the MEDLINE/ PubMed database (years: 1966-present) was carried out using the search terms observational or observational study(ies), historical control, nonrandomized, and postmarketing surveillance. All references comparing observational studies with randomized controlled trials were obtained and reviewed and were also hand-checked for studies not identified in the database searches.
RESULTS: Observational studies play an important role in investigating treatment outcomes. Data from large observational studies can clarify the tolerability profile of marketed medicines. In particular, observational studies can be of benefit in the study of large, heterogeneous patient populations with complex, chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus. Observational studies have played a key role in supporting the results of Phase III studies of insulin analogues for the treatment of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Future observational studies in the field of diabetes such as PREDICTIVE (Predictable Results and Experience in Diabetes through Intensification and Control to Target: an International Variability Evaluation) and IMPROVE will further our understanding of this global pandemic.
CONCLUSIONS: Well-designed observational studies can play a key role in supporting the evidence base for drugs and therapies. Current evidence suggests that observational studies can be conducted using the same exacting and rigorous standards as are used for RCTs. The observational study design should be considered as a complementary rather than a rival analytic technique.},

One area of waste involves bias in reporting research, which compromises the usability of published reports. In response, there has been an upsurge in interest and research in the scientific process of writing, editing, peer reviewing, and publishing (that is, journalology) of biomedical research. One reason for bias in reporting and the problem of unusable reports could be due to authors lacking knowledge or engaging in questionable practices while designing, conducting, or reporting their research. Another might be that the peer review process for journal publication has serious flaws, including possibly being ineffective, and having poorly trained and poorly motivated reviewers. Similarly, many journal editors have limited knowledge related to publication ethics. This can ultimately have a negative impact on the healthcare system. There have been repeated calls for better, more numerous training opportunities in writing for publication, peer review, and publishing. However, little research has taken stock of journalology training opportunities or evaluations of their effectiveness.},

However, the constellation of techniques required for scale development and evaluation can be onerous, jargon-filled, unfamiliar, and resource-intensive. Further, it is often not a part of graduate training. Therefore, our goal was to concisely review the process of scale development in as straightforward a manner as possible, both to facilitate the development of new, valid, and reliable scales, and to help improve existing ones. To do this, we have created a primer for best practices for scale development in measuring complex phenomena. This is not a systematic review, but rather the amalgamation of technical literature and lessons learned from our experiences spent creating or adapting a number of scales over the past several decades. We identified three phases that span nine steps. In the first phase, items are generated and the validity of their content is assessed. In the second phase, the scale is constructed. Steps in scale construction include pre-testing the questions, administering the survey, reducing the number of items, and understanding how many factors the scale captures. In the third phase, scale evaluation, the number of dimensions is tested, reliability is tested, and validity is assessed. We have also added examples of best practices to each step. In sum, this primer will equip both scientists and practitioners to understand the ontology and methodology of scale development and validation, thereby facilitating the advancement of our understanding of a range of health, social, and behavioral outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background
Although health technology assessment (HTA) systems base their decision making process either on economic evaluations or comparative clinical benefit assessment, a central aim of recent approaches to value measurement, including value based assessment and pricing, points towards the incorporation of supplementary evidence and criteria that capture additional dimensions of value.

Objective
To study the practices, processes and policies of value-assessment for new medicines across eight European countries and the role of HTA beyond economic evaluation and clinical benefit assessment.

Methods
A systematic (peer review and grey) literature review was conducted using an analytical framework examining: (1) ‘Responsibilities and structure of HTA agencies’; (2) ‘Evidence and evaluation criteria considered in HTAs’; (3) ‘Methods and techniques applied in HTAs’; and (4) ‘Outcomes and implementation of HTAs’. Study countries were France, Germany, England, Sweden, Italy, Netherlands, Poland and Spain. Evidence from the literature was validated and updated through two rounds of feedback involving primary data collection from national experts.

Results
All countries assess similar types of evidence; however, the specific criteria/endpoints used, their level of provision and requirement, and the way they are incorporated (e.g. explicitly vs. implicitly) varies across countries, with their relative importance remaining generally unknown. Incorporation of additional ‘social value judgements’ (beyond clinical benefit assessment) and economic evaluation could help explain heterogeneity in coverage recommendations and decision-making.

Conclusion
More comprehensive and systematic assessment procedures characterised by increased transparency, in terms of selection of evaluation criteria, their importance and intensity of use, could lead to more rational evidence-based decision-making, possibly improving efficiency in resource allocation, while also raising public confidence and fairness.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: As evidence-based medicine assumes increasing importance, there is a need for high-quality reporting of clinical studies. A recent review of clinical platelet (PLT) studies indicated variability in reporting. We undertook a critical analysis of PLT transfusion studies to determine the quality of reporting. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A systematic MEDLINE search for clinical studies of PLT transfusion was performed to identify articles. Relevant observational studies (OBS) were critiqued using the STROBE checklist and randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) using the CONSORT checklist. Studies were further evaluated with a PLT-specific checklist developed by the authors. Observations were analyzed descriptively and using Pareto analysis. RESULTS: A total of 772 articles were identified by the search. Eighty-six articles (23 RCTs and 63 OBS) met eligibility criteria. All RCTs, and a similar number of OBS (24), were randomly selected for analysis. Studies reported the scientific background and rationale, key results, and outcomes. OBS frequently did not consider bias and confounders. RCTs frequently did not explain bias, interim analyses, stopping rules, success of blinding, or weaknesses of multiple analyses. The PLT-specific critique found many studies adequately reported basics of the PLT product, PLT increment, and transfusion reactions. Studies frequently failed to report specific details of PLT compatibility, details of product preparation, and use of other blood products. CONCLUSION: Recently published articles of clinical PLT transfusion share common strengths and weaknesses. The quality of reporting may be improved by providing guidelines to authors and journal editors that list the essential elements of a well-reported clinical study of PLT transfusion.},

What, then, should we think about researchers who use the wrong techniques (either wilfully or in ignorance), use the right techniques wrongly, misinterpret their results, report their results selectively, cite the literature selectively, and draw unjustified conclusions? We should be appalled.

To ensure a uniform and detailed reporting of observational studies experts came out with a checklist of items, named 'Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology' (STROBE). The present study examines the adherence of observational studies published in selected Indian journals from 2011-2015 to STROBE Statement.
Method: 7 open access Indian journals, belonging to different specialities were selected. All the observational studies were assessed by 5 independent reviewers for the adherence to STROBE checklist as 'yes, partly and no'. The completeness of reporting was also assessed.
Results: A total of 271 articles were examined. Only 10 items (Abstract, Background/rationale, Objectives, Study Setting, Data sources/ measurement, Quantitative variables, number of Participants at each stage, Characteristics of study participants, Key results) out of the 22 items and their subdivisions of STROBE were adhered to, in more than 70\% of articles. Other 10 items (bias, subgroup analysis, addressing missing data, sensitivity analysis, reason for nonparticipation, flow diagram, missing data) had adherence in less than 30\% of the articles. The completeness of reporting was 50.5\%, 49.12\% and 43.06\% in cross sectional, cohort and case control study, respectively.
Conclusion: The overall reporting was suboptimal. The completeness of reporting did not differ in the three types of observational study designs.},

Recommendations based on inadequate evidence often require reversal when sufficient data become available,$^{\textrm{6}}$while timely implementation of recommendations based on strong evidence can save lives.$^{\textrm{6}}$In this article, we suggest an approach to classifying strength of recommendations. We direct our discussion primarily at clinicians who make treatment recommendations that they hope their colleagues will follow. However, we believe that any clinician who attends to{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The reasons for this concern have focused on methodological issues in the conduct and publication of epidemiologic research. This commentary suggests that another reason for discrepant findings may be that animal research is producing implausible hypotheses. Many animal studies are methodologically weak, and the animal literature is not systematically reviewed and synthesized. Moreover, most bodies of animal literature may be so heterogeneous that they can be used selectively to support the plausibility of almost any epidemiology study result. Epidemiologists themselves also do not consistently conduct systematic reviews of bodies of biological evidence which might point to sources of bias in an evidence base. Animal research will likely continue to provide the biological basis for epidemiological investigation, but substantial improvement is needed in how it is conducted and synthesized to improve the predictability of animal studies for the human condition.},

My initial wariness about guidelines for observational research was overcome by focusing on clarity of reporting, rather than on how research should be done. Areas of tension that arose when drafting STROBE include the problem of finding common ground among researchers with different research backgrounds, questions of the intended audience (professional epidemiologists or statisticians vs. all researchers who use epidemiologic study designs), and the fine line between encouraging clarity of reporting vs. prescribing how to do research. STROBE is not an instrument to evaluate the quality of research: research can be reported clearly or not, irrespective of its intrinsic quality. However, the ultimate benefit of STROBE might be that more comprehensive reporting allows for better discussions about published observational research, which may lead to better decisions about what new analyses or new studies are needed to solve a problem.},

	abstract = {Scientific peer-review and publication systems incur a huge burden in terms of costs and time. Innovative alternatives have been proposed to improve the systems, but assessing their impact in experimental studies is not feasible at a systemic level. We developed an agent-based model by adopting a unified view of peer review and publication systems and calibrating it with empirical journal data in the biomedical and life sciences. We modeled researchers, research manuscripts and scientific journals as agents. Researchers were characterized by their scientific level and resources, manuscripts by their scientific value, and journals by their reputation and acceptance or rejection thresholds. These state variables were used in submodels for various processes such as production of articles, submissions to target journals, in-house and external peer review, and resubmissions. We collected data for a sample of biomedical and life sciences journals regarding acceptance rates, resubmission patterns and total number of published articles. We adjusted submodel parameters so that the agent-based model outputs fit these empirical data. We simulated 105 journals, 25,000 researchers and 410,000 manuscripts over 10 years. A mean of 33,600 articles were published per year; 19 \% of submitted manuscripts remained unpublished. The mean acceptance rate was 21 \% after external peer review and rejection rate 32 \% after in-house review; 15 \% publications resulted from the first submission, 47 \% the second submission and 20 \% the third submission. All decisions in the model were mainly driven by the scientific value, whereas journal targeting and persistence in resubmission defined whether a manuscript would be published or abandoned after one or many rejections. This agent-based model may help in better understanding the determinants of the scientific publication and peer-review systems. It may also help in assessing and identifying the most promising alternative systems of peer review.},

	abstract = {Objective
We describe the use of an integrated knowledge translation (KT) approach in the development of the CONsolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials extension for equity (‘CONSORT-Equity 2017’), and advisory board-research team members’ (‘the team’) perceptions of the integrated KT process.

Design
This is an observational study to describe team processes and experience with a structured integrated KT approach to develop CONSORT-Equity 2017. Participant observation to describe team processes and a survey were used with the 38 team members.

Setting
Use of the CONSORT health research reporting guideline contributes to an evidence base for health systems decision-making, and CONSORT-Equity 2017 may improve reporting about health equity-relevant evidence. An integrated KT research approach engages knowledge users (those for whom the research is meant to be useful) with researchers to co-develop research evidence and is more likely to produce findings that are applied in practice or policy.

Participants
Researchers adopted an integrated KT approach and invited knowledge users to form a team.

Results
An integrated KT approach was used in the development of CONSORT-Equity 2017 and structured replicable steps. The process for co-developing the reporting guideline involved two stages: (1) establishing guiding features for co-development and (2) research actions that supported the co-development of the reporting guideline. Stage 1 consisted of four steps: finding common ground, forming an advisory board, committing to ethical guidance and clarifying theoretical research assumptions. Bound by the stage 1 guiding features of an integrated KT approach, stage 2 consisted of five steps during which studies for consensus-based reporting guidelines were conducted. Of 38 team members, 25 (67.5\%) completed a survey about their perceptions of the integrated KT approach.

Conclusions
An integrated KT approach can be used to engage a team to co-develop reporting guidelines. Further study is needed to understand the use of an integrated KT approach in the development of reporting guidelines.},

Health technology assessment (HTA) grew out of this field and was developed in the U.S. Office of Technology Assessment (OTA). However, the OTA was closed in 1995. The links between technology assessment and health technology assessment were more-or-less lost after the dissolution of OTA, and few workers in the field of HTA seem familiar with the roots of the field in the more general and social-oriented technology assessment.},

	abstract = {Background
The movement of evidence-based practices (EBPs) into routine clinical usage is not spontaneous, but requires focused efforts. The field of implementation science has developed to facilitate the spread of EBPs, including both psychosocial and medical interventions for mental and physical health concerns.

Discussion
The authors aim to introduce implementation science principles to non-specialist investigators, administrators, and policymakers seeking to become familiar with this emerging field. This introduction is based on published literature and the authors’ experience as researchers in the field, as well as extensive service as implementation science grant reviewers., Implementation science is “the scientific study of methods to promote the systematic uptake of research findings and other EBPs into routine practice, and, hence, to improve the quality and effectiveness of health services.” Implementation science is distinct from, but shares characteristics with, both quality improvement and dissemination methods. Implementation studies can be either assess naturalistic variability or measure change in response to planned intervention. Implementation studies typically employ mixed quantitative-qualitative designs, identifying factors that impact uptake across multiple levels, including patient, provider, clinic, facility, organization, and often the broader community and policy environment. Accordingly, implementation science requires a solid grounding in theory and the involvement of trans-disciplinary research teams.

Summary
The business case for implementation science is clear: As healthcare systems work under increasingly dynamic and resource-constrained conditions, evidence-based strategies are essential in order to ensure that research investments maximize healthcare value and improve public health. Implementation science plays a critical role in supporting these efforts.},

Our aim was to review recent practice in reporting these studies, and develop recommendations for the future. By searching papers published in 24 major medical and epidemiological journals between January 2010 and March 2013 using PubMed, Scopus and Web of Knowledge, we identified 32 papers reporting case-cohort studies. The median subcohort sampling fraction was 4.1\% (interquartile range 3.7\% to 9.1\%). The papers varied in their approaches to describing the numbers of individuals in the original cohort and the subcohort, presenting descriptive data, and in the level of detail provided about the statistical methods used, so it was not always possible to be sure that appropriate analyses had been conducted. Based on the findings of our review, we make recommendations about reporting of the study design, subcohort definition, numbers of participants, descriptive information and statistical methods, which could be used alongside existing STROBE guidelines for reporting observational studies.},

This study evaluated how dental journals use reporting guidelines. All editors of dental journals registered on the 2013 Journal Citation Reports list (n=81) were invited to participate. The data were collected by a self-reported web-based questionnaire. Information about the profile of journal/editor and on the use of reporting guidelines by journals was gathered. Information/recommendations about the use of reporting guidelines were collected from the websites of all journals. Data were descriptively analyzed and frequencies were summarized. Thirty-four (42\%) editors completed the questionnaire. Most journals are members of Committee on Publication Ethics (64.7\%) and/or follow the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors recommendations (20.6\%), while 26.5\% are not members of any editorial group. Most editors are unfamiliar with the EQUATOR Network (55.9\%), do not work full time (85.3\%) and 88.2\% have some income/payment. Most of them received educational training for this position (55.9\%). The CONSORT Statement was endorsed by 61.8\% of journals. Information from websites showed that 44.4\% journals do not recommend any reporting guideline, 51.9\% mention CONSORT Statement in the website and 28.4\% only recommend the use of CONSORT Statement. There is clearly room for improving the use of reporting guidelines in dental journals. Broadening the understanding and the endorsement/adherence/implementation of reporting guidelines by journals may promote quality and transparence of published dental research.Key Words: guideline as topic; evidence-based dentistry; publishing},

        E-learning is the use of Internet technologies to enhance knowledge and performance. E-learning technologies offer learners control over content, learning sequence, pace of learning, time, and often media, allowing them to tailor their experiences to meet their personal learning objectives. In diverse medical education contexts, e-learning appears to be at least as effective as traditional instructor-led methods such as lectures. Students do not see e-learning as replacing traditional instructor-led training but as a complement to it, forming part of a blended-learning strategy. A developing infrastructure to support e-learning within medical education includes repositories, or digital libraries, to manage access to e-learning materials, consensus on technical standardization, and methods for peer review of these resources. E-learning presents numerous research opportunities for faculty, along with continuing challenges for documenting scholarship. Innovations in e-learning technologies point toward a revolution in education, allowing learning to be individualized (adaptive learning), enhancing learners' interactions with others (collaborative learning), and transforming the role of the teacher. The integration of e-learning into medical education can catalyze the shift toward applying adult learning theory, where educators will no longer serve mainly as the distributors of content, but will become more involved as facilitators of learning and assessors of competency.},

	abstract = {Despite the proposal of minimum reporting guidelines for metabolomics over a decade ago, reporting on the data analysis step in metabolomics studies has been shown to be unclear and incomplete. Major omissions and a lack of logical flow render the data analysis\&rsquo; sections in metabolomics studies impossible to follow, and therefore replicate or even imitate. Here, we propose possible reasons why the original reporting guidelines have had poor adherence and present an approach to improve their uptake. We present in this paper an R markdown reporting template file that guides the production of text and generates workflow diagrams based on user input. This R Markdown template contains, as an example in this instance, a set of minimum information requirements specifically for the data pre-treatment and data analysis section of biomarker discovery metabolomics studies, (gleaned directly from the original proposed guidelines by Goodacre at al). These minimum requirements are presented in the format of a questionnaire checklist in an R markdown template file. The R Markdown reporting template proposed here can be presented as a starting point to encourage the data analysis section of a metabolomics manuscript to have a more logical presentation and to contain enough information to be understandable and reusable. The idea is that these guidelines would be open to user feedback, modification and updating by the metabolomics community via GitHub.},

The median of 1.6 years of training in statistics and measurement was mainly devoted to the modally 1-year introductory statistics course, leaving little room for advanced study. Curricular enhancements were noted in statistics and to a minor degree in measurement. Additional coverage of both fundamental and innovative quantitative methodology is needed. The research design curriculum has largely stagnated, a cause for great concern. Elite programs showed no overall advantage in quantitative training. Forces that support curricular innovation are characterized. Human capital challenges to quantitative training, including recruiting and supporting young quantitative faculty, are discussed.

	abstract = {BackgroundWe aimed to assess the endorsement of the Consolidation Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement by Chinese journals of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and its incorporation into their editorial processes.MethodsPubMed, Embase and major Chinese databases were searched to identify journals of TCM from China for inclusion. The latest ?instruction for authors? (IFA) of each included journal was obtained and any text mentioning CONSORT or CONSORT extension papers was extracted. Subsequently, the editor of each of the included journals was surveyed about their journal's endorsement of the CONSORT recommendations and their incorporation into editorial and peer review processes.ResultsSixty-three journals of TCM from China were examined. Of these, only three (5\%) and one (2\%) of the 63 journals mentioned the CONSORT statement and extension papers, respectively, in their IFA. Fifty-four of 63 (86\%) of surveyed journals responded, with the majority of respondents being editors. Only 20\% (11/54) of the respondents reported that they had any knowledge of the CONSORT statement. Only 6\% (3/54) of the editors reported that they required authors to comply with the CONSORT statement or that they incorporated it into their peer review and editorial processes.ConclusionsTCM journals in China endorsing the CONSORT statement constituted a small percentage of the total. The majority of editors surveyed were not familiar with the content of the CONSORT statement and extension papers. We strongly recommend that the China Periodicals Association issue a policy to promote the endorsement of the CONSORT statement and conduct relevant training for journal editors in China.},

	abstract = {Reporting guidelines can be used to encourage standardised and comprehensive reporting of health research. In light of the global commitment to health equity, we have previously developed and published a reporting guideline for equity-focused systematic reviews (PRISMA-E 2012). The objectives of this study were to explore the utility of the equity extension items included in PRISMA-E 2012 from a systematic review author perspective, including facilitators and barriers to its use. This will assist in designing dissemination and knowledge translation strategies. We conducted a survey of systematic review authors to expose them to the new items in PRISMA-E 2012, establish the extent to which they had historically addressed those items in their own reviews, and gather feedback on the usefulness of the new items. Data were analysed using Microsoft Excel 2008 and Stata (version 11.2 for Mac). Of 151 respondents completing the survey, 18.5\% (95\% CI: 12.7\% to 25.7\%) had not heard of the PRISMA statement before, although 83.4\% (95\% CI: 77.5\% to 89.3\%) indicated that they plan to use PRISMA-E 2012 in the future, depending on the focus of their review. Most (68.9\%; 95\% CI: 60.8\% to 76.2\%) thought that using PRISMA-E 2012 would lead them to conduct their reviews differently. Important facilitators to using PRISMA-E 2012 identified by respondents were journal endorsement and incorporation of the elements of the guideline into systematic review software. Barriers identified were lack of time, word limits and the availability of equity data in primary research. This study has been the first to ‘road-test’ the new PRISMA-E 2012 reporting guideline and the findings are encouraging. They confirm the acceptability and potential utility of the guideline to assist review authors in reporting on equity in their reviews. The uptake and impact of PRISMA-E 2012 over time on design, conduct and reporting of primary research and systematic reviews should continue to be examined.},

From the data provided, it appears that non-publication was primarily a result of failure to write up and submit the trial results rather than rejection of submitted manuscripts.

Does this imply that many scientific facts are false as well? To find out, we explore the process by which a claim becomes fact. We model the community’s confidence in a claim as a Markov process with successive published results shifting the degree of belief. Publication bias in favor of positive findings influences the distribution of published results. We find that unless a sufficient fraction of negative results are published, false claims frequently can become canonized as fact. Data-dredging, p-hacking, and similar behaviors exacerbate the problem. Should negative results become easier to publish as a claim approaches acceptance as a fact, however, true and false claims would be more readily distinguished. To the degree that the model reflects the real world, there may be serious concerns about the validity of purported facts in some disciplines.},

	abstract = {Objective To describe the development of a behavior-change
intervention to improve implementation of the Consolidated
Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines.
Design A systematic approach to intervention development,
accounting for theory, evidence, and practical issues,
was employed. Development consisted of the following steps:
(1) Identify the problem and stakeholders to be targeted. (2)
Determine which barriers and facilitators need to be addressed
through a series of semistructured interviews with trial authors
and journal editors and a survey of journal editors. Thematic
content analysis was used to group interview data into the 12
domains of the theoretical domains framework (TDF); survey
data were summarized using descriptive statistics. (3) Identify
intervention components (mapped relevant theoretical domains
to established behavior change techniques guided by evidence
and experts).
Results Six editors of journals that endorse CONSORT, 1
editor of a nonendorsing journal, and 10 authors of trials submitted
to Implementation Science and the Canadian Medical
Association Journal were interviewed. Seventy-eight journal editors
(27.6\% response rate) completed the survey. Only 13\% of
CONSORT-endorsing journals (n=56) require that peer reviewers
check for CONSORT adherence, and only 35.3\% indicate using
CONSORT to determine whether a trial should be published.
Eighty-one percent of editors expressed support for an electronic
CONSORT tool, and 59\% wanted educational tutorials
about CONSORT. Based on our findings, the following TDF
domains and behavior change strategies have been identified
as key target areas moving forward: knowledge: provision of
CONSORT documents and evidence of CONSORT impact; skills:
development of training materials and webinars about how to
use CONSORT; beliefs about consequences and environmental
context and resources: development of an electronic tool to
facilitate compliance by authors and for editors/reviewers; motivations
and goals: providing assessments on the completeness
of trial reporting at individual journals to demonstrate need for
improvement; social influence: use of social media to connect
with and recruit key stakeholders to disseminate CONSORT
information.
Conclusions A more active approach than previously used is
needed to ensure CONSORT implementation by authors and
journal editors and peer reviewers. The identified interventions
should be developed, implemented, and evaluated.},

	abstract = {Objective
Cross-sectional blindness prevalence surveys are essential to plan and monitor eye care services. Incomplete or inaccurate reporting can prevent effective translation of research findings. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement is a 32 item checklist developed to improve reporting of observational studies. The aim of this study was to assess the completeness of reporting in blindness prevalence surveys in low and middle income countries (LMICs) using STROBE.

Methods
MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science databases were searched on April 8 2016 to identify cross-sectional blindness prevalence surveys undertaken in LMICs and published after STROBE was published in December 2007. The STROBE tool was applied to all included studies, and each STROBE item was categorized as ‘yes’ (met criteria), ‘no’ (did not meet criteria) or ‘not applicable’. The ‘Completeness of reporting (COR) score’ for each manuscript was calculated: COR score = yes / [yes + no]. In journals with included studies the instructions to authors and reviewers were checked for reference to STROBE.

Results
The 89 included studies were undertaken in 32 countries and published in 37 journals. The mean COR score was 60.9\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 58.1–63.7\%; range 30.8–88.9\%). The mean COR score did not differ between surveys published in journals with author instructions referring to STROBE (10/37 journals; 61.1\%, 95\%CI 56.4–65.8\%) or in journals where STROBE was not mentioned (60.9\%, 95\%CI 57.4–64.3\%; p = 0.93).

Conclusion
While reporting in blindness prevalence surveys is strong in some areas, others need improvement. We recommend that more journals adopt the STROBE checklist and ensure it is used by authors and reviewers.},

	abstract = {Introduction:
 The inadequate reporting of cross-sectional studies, as in the case of the prevalence of metabolic syndrome, could cause problems in the synthesis of new evidence and lead to errors in the formulation of public policies. 


Objective:
 To evaluate the reporting quality of the articles regarding metabolic syndrome prevalence in Peruvian adults using the STROBE recommendations. 


Methods:
 We conducted a thorough literature search with the terms "Metabolic Syndrome", "Sindrome Metabolico" and "Peru" in MEDLINE/PubMed, LILACS, SciELO, LIPECS and BVS-Peru until December 2014. We selected those who were population-based observational studies with randomized sampling that reported prevalence of metabolic syndrome in adults aged 18 or more of both sexes. Information was analysed through the STROBE score per item and recommendation. 


Results:
 Seventeen articles were included in this study. All articles met the recommendations related to the report of the study's rationale, design, and provision of summary measures. The recommendations with the lowest scores were those related to the sensitivity analysis (8\%, n= 1/17), participant flowchart (18\%, n= 3/17), missing data analysis (24\%, n= 4/17), and number of participants in each study phase (24\%, n= 4/17). 


Conclusion:
 Cross-sectional studies regarding the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in peruvian adults have an inadequate reporting on the methods and results sections. We identified a clear need to improve the quality of such studies.},

	abstract = {Background
The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement was developed to improve the reporting of observational studies. We aimed to evaluate the quality of reporting in cohort studies and case-control studies among observational studies published in the Korean Journal of Family Medicine.

Methods
We searched for cohort studies and case-control studies published as original articles in the Journal of the Korean Academy of Family Medicine during the period January 1992 through December 2009. The main outcome measures were the number and proportion of cohort studies and case-control studies that reported each of 22 checklist items of STROBE.

Results
We identified a total of 84 articles, of which 46 articles were cohort studies and 38 were case-control studies. Concerning methods, study designs (10\%), bias (13\%), study size (0\%), statistical methods (12-c and 12-e items, 0\%; 12-d item, cohort study, 6\%) have been poorly reported. Of results, participants (5-6\%), descriptive data (14-b item, 5\%), and funding (1\%) among other information have been poorly reported.

Conclusion
The degree of adherence the STROBE recommendations was relatively low in cohort studies and case-control studies published in the Korean Journal of Family Medicine. An effort to improve the reporting of observational studies by application and recommendation of the STROBE statement is required.},

The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement is a set of recommendations about what should be included in a more accurate and complete description of observational studies.

Aim:
The aim was to assess the quality of reporting of cross-sectional studies by evaluating the extent to which they adhere to the STROBE statement.

Materials and Methods:
This study has a cross-sectional design. All the articles published as original articles in Indian Journal of Community Medicine from January 2010 to September 2011 were downloaded from the journal website. A total of 96 articles were downloaded out of which 80 were found to have a cross-sectional design. Variables were: (1) Percentage of STROBE items included in a report and (2) percentage of articles reporting each item in the STROBE checklist. Data analysis was done by descriptive statistics using frequencies and percentages.

Results:
A total of 80 articles were evaluated. About 46\% (37/80) articles reported 12–15 items of the STROBE checklist. Bias, nonparticipants and reasons for nonparticipation, other analyses done, generalizability, and source of funding were reported by {\textless} 25\% of studies. The most frequently reported items of the checklist were summary of what was done and what was found in the abstract, background/rationale, objectives, setting, outcome data, key results in discussion, interpretation of results. None of the articles reported all items of the STROBE checklist.

Conclusion:
This study reveals that the quality of reporting cross-sectional studies in Indian Journal of Community Medicine is not satisfactory and there is room for improvement.},

Two raters independently assessed 49 randomly selected articles describing stroke research published from 1999 to 2003 in six journals: American Journal of Epidemiology, Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, Stroke, Annals of Neurology, Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, and American Journal of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. On average, 17 of the 33 checklist criteria were reported. Criteria describing the study design were better reported than those related to internal validity. No relation was found between study type (etiologic or prognostic) or word count and quality of reporting. A flow diagram for summarizing participant flow through a study was developed.

	abstract = {Background:
The inadequate reporting of cross-sectional studies, as in the case of the prevalence of Congenital Anomaly, could cause challenges in the synthesis of new evidence and make possible mistakes in the creation of public policies. This study was conducted to critically appraise the quality of the articles involving congenital anomaly prevalence in Iranian infants with the STROBE recommendations.

Methods:
We performed a thorough literature search using the words “congenital anomaly” “birth defect” and “Iran” in MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, SID, Elmnet, Magiran, IranDoc, Iranmedex, and Google Scholar until Aug 2017. In this critical appraisal we focused on cross-sectional studies that reported the prevalence of congenital anomaly in Iranian infants. Data were analyzed using the STROBE score per item and recommendation.

Results:
The results of 17 selected articles on Congenital Anomaly prevalence showed that the overall accordance of the cross-sectional study reports with STROBE recommendations was about 63\%. All articles met the recommendations associated with the report of the study’s rationale, objectives, setting, key results and provision of summary measures. Methods and results were the weakest part of the articles, in which recommendations associated with the participant flowchart and missing data analysis were not reported. The recommendations with the lowest scores were those related to the sensitivity analysis (6\%, n=1/17), bias (6\%, n=1/17), and funding (41\%, n=7/17).

Conclusion:
Cross-sectional studies about the prevalence of congenital anomaly in Iranian infants have an insufficient reporting on the methods and results parts. We recognized a clear need to increase the quality of such studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies have linked full-calorie sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) with greater weight gain and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.
OBJECTIVE: We prospectively examined the association between consumption of SSBs and the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in women.
DESIGN: Women (n = 88,520) from the Nurses' Health Study aged 34-59 y, without previously diagnosed coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, or diabetes in 1980, were followed from 1980 to 2004. Consumption of SSBs was derived from 7 repeated food-frequency questionnaires administered between 1980 and 2002. Relative risks (RRs) for CHD were calculated by using Cox proportional hazards models and adjusted for known cardiovascular disease risk factors.
RESULTS: During 24 y of follow-up, we ascertained 3105 incident cases of CHD (nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal CHD). After standard and dietary risk factors were adjusted for, the RRs (and 95\% CIs) of CHD according to categories of cumulative average of SSB consumption ({\textless}1/mo, 1-4/mo, 2-6/wk, 1/d, and {\textgreater} or =2 servings/d) were 1.0, 0.96 (0.87, 1.06), 1.04 (0.95, 1.14), 1.23 (1.06, 1.43), and 1.35 (1.07, 1.69) (P for trend {\textless} 0.001). Additional adjustment for body mass index, energy intake, and incident diabetes attenuated the associations, but they remained significant. Artificially sweetened beverages were not associated with CHD.
CONCLUSION: Regular consumption of SSBs is associated with a higher risk of CHD in women, even after other unhealthful lifestyle or dietary factors are accounted for.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Our aim was to determine the coverage of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) by the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trial (CONSORT) Statement and its extensions and to evaluate the potential workload for authors to adhere to the guidelines.
Study Design and Setting
We identified CONSORT extensions from the CONSORT Web site. We randomly selected a sample of 1,000 RCTs indexed in PubMed in 2016 and recorded whether they were covered by CONSORT extensions for specific study designs or interventions. We evaluated the potential workload for authors by counting the number of documents and pages they have to consult to have a full understanding of the guidelines.
Results
We identified 14 extensions. Only one extension was updated concurrently with the main CONSORT in 2010, three were updated after 2–7 years, and three are still based on CONSORT 2001. Overall, 81\% of RCTs are covered by relevant CONSORT guidelines; missing extensions for specific study designs were under development at the time of the search (Nov 2018). However, 6 of 10 extensions covered {\textless}2\% of the trials. A median [Q1–Q3] of 4 [4–5] documents and 67 [57–78] pages should be consulted.
Conclusion
Most RCTs indexed in PubMed are covered by the CONSORT Statement and extensions, but the potential workload for authors could be high.},

	doi = {10.12688/f1000research.20556.1},
	abstract = {Background:
              Improving the completeness of reporting of biomedical research is essential for improving its usability. For this reason, hundreds of reporting guidelines have been created in the last few decades but adherence to these remains suboptimal. This survey aims to inform future evaluations of interventions to improve adherence to reporting guidelines. In particular, it gathers editors’ perceptions of a range of interventions at various stages in the editorial process.  
            
            
              Methods:
              We surveyed biomedical journal editors that were knowledgeable about this topic. The questionnaire included open and closed questions that explored (i) the current practice of their journals, (ii) their perceptions of the ease of implementation and the potential effectiveness of different interventions, (iii) the barriers and facilitators associated with these interventions, and (iv) suggestions for future interventions and incentives.
            
            
              Results:
              Of the 99 editors invited, 24 (24\%) completed the survey. Involving trained editors or administrative staff was deemed the potentially most effective intervention but, at the same time, it was considered moderately difficult to implement due to logistic and resource issues. Participants believed that checking adherence to guidelines goes beyond the role of peer reviewers and could decrease the overall quality of reviews. Journals incentivising adherence, and publishers and medical institutions encouraging journals to adopt strategies to boost adherence were two recurrent themes.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              Further evaluation of interventions are required. These evaluations could take into account the points raised in this survey.},

	abstract = {Objectives To improve the trustworthiness of evidence, studies should be prospectively registered and research reports should adhere to existing standards. We aimed to systematically assess the degree to which endocrinology and internal medicine journals endorse study registration and reporting standards for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews (SRs) and observational studies (ObS). Additionally, we evaluated characteristics that predict endorsement of reporting or registration mechanism by these journals.
Design Meta-epidemiological study.
Setting Journals included in the ‘Endocrinology and Metabolism’ and ‘General and Internal Medicine’ 2017 Journal Citation Reports.
Participants Journals with an impact factor of ≥1.0, focused on clinical medicine, and those who publish RCTs, SRs and ObS were included.
Primary outcomes Requirement of adherence to reporting guideline and study registration as determined from the journals’ author instructions.
Results Of the 170 (82 endocrinology and 88 internal medicine) eligible journals, endorsing of reporting standards was the highest for RCTs, with 35 (43\%) of endocrine journals and 55 (63\%) of internal medicine journals followed by SRs, with 21 (26\%) and 48 (55\%), respectively, and lastly, by ObS with 41 (50\%) of endocrine journals and 21 (24\%) of internal medicine journals. In 78 (46\%) journals RCTs were required to be registered and published in adherence to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement. Only 11 (6\%) journals required registration of SRs. Internal medicine journals were more likely to endorse reporting guidelines than endocrine journals except for Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology. No other journal characteristic proved to be an independent predictor of reporting standard endorsement for RCTs besides trial registration.
Conclusion Our results highlight that study registration requirement and reporting guideline endorsement are suboptimal in internal medicine and endocrine journals. This malpractice may be further enhanced since endorsement does not imply enforcement, impairing the practice of evidence-based medicine.},

	doi = {10.7326/0003-4819-134-8-200104170-00012},
	abstract = {Overwhelming evidence now indicates that the quality of reporting of randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) is less than optimal. Recent methodologic analyses indicate that inadequate reporting and design are associated with biased estimates of treatment effects. Such systematic error is seriously damaging to RCTs, which boast the elimination of systematic error as their primary hallmark. Systematic error in RCTs reflects poor science, and poor science threatens proper ethical standards. A group of scientists and editors developed the CONSORT (Con solidated S tandards o f R eporting T rials) statement to improve the quality of reporting of RCTs. The statement consists of a checklist and flow diagram that authors can use for reporting an RCT. Many leading medical journals and major international editorial groups have adopted the CONSORT statement. The CONSORT statement facilitates critical appraisal and interpretation of RCTs by providing guidance to authors about how to improve the reporting of their trials. This explanatory and elaboration document is intended to enhance the use, understanding, and dissemination of the CONSORT statement. The meaning and rationale for each checklist item are presented. For most items, at least one published example of good reporting and, where possible, references to relevant empirical studies are provided. Several examples of flow diagrams are included. The CONSORT statement, this explanatory and elaboration document, and the associated Web site ( http://www.consort-statement.org ) should be helpful resources to improve reporting of randomized trials.

	title = {Digital {Education} in {Health} {Professions}: {The} {Need} for {Overarching} {Evidence} {Synthesis}},
	abstract = {Synthesizing evidence from randomized controlled trials of digital health education poses some challenges. These include a lack of clear categorization of digital health education in the literature; constantly evolving concepts, pedagogies, or theories; and a multitude of methods, features, technologies, or delivery settings. The Digital Health Education Collaboration was established to evaluate the evidence on digital education in health professions; inform policymakers, educators, and students; and ultimately, change the way in which these professionals learn and are taught. The aim of this paper is to present the overarching methodology that we use to synthesize evidence across our digital health education reviews and to discuss challenges related to the process. For our research, we followed Cochrane recommendations for the conduct of systematic reviews; all reviews are reported according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidance. This included assembling experts in various digital health education fields; identifying gaps in the evidence base; formulating focused research questions, aims, and outcome measures; choosing appropriate search terms and databases; defining inclusion and exclusion criteria; running the searches jointly with librarians and information specialists; managing abstracts; retrieving full-text versions of papers; extracting and storing large datasets, critically appraising the quality of studies; analyzing data; discussing findings; drawing meaningful conclusions; and drafting research papers. The approach used for synthesizing evidence from digital health education trials is commonly regarded as the most rigorous benchmark for conducting systematic reviews. Although we acknowledge the presence of certain biases ingrained in the process, we have clearly highlighted and minimized those biases by strictly adhering to scientific rigor, methodological integrity, and standard operating procedures. This paper will be a valuable asset for researchers and methodologists undertaking systematic reviews in digital health education.},

	abstract = {Collaborative writing may evoke conflict between individuals’ feeling of contribution and their sense of ownership toward the collective outcomes. The present study tested the relations between perceived psychological ownership, perceived quality of the product, and perceived learning in five experimental conditions: two collaborative, two sharing, and a control. Analysis of the changes made between versions revealed differences in quantity and in types of changes between collaboration, sharing, and control conditions. Results showed that collaboration may improve the perceived quality of the written product more than sharing or control. In addition, less intrusive collaboration seems to enhance the sense of perceived learning. The relation between perceived ownership and perceived learning was mediated by perceived quality of the written product. We conclude that students may avoid collaboration partly because they do not want to lose a sense of personal ownership or to lessen peer ownership.},

	abstract = {Collaborative writing may evoke conflict between individuals’ feeling of contribution and their sense of ownership toward the collective outcomes. The present study tested the relations between perceived psychological ownership, perceived quality of the product, and perceived learning in five experimental conditions: two collaborative, two sharing, and a control. Analysis of the changes made between versions revealed differences in quantity and in types of changes between collaboration, sharing, and control conditions. Results showed that collaboration may improve the perceived quality of the written product more than sharing or control. In addition, less intrusive collaboration seems to enhance the sense of perceived learning. The relation between perceived ownership and perceived learning was mediated by perceived quality of the written product. We conclude that students may avoid collaboration partly because they do not want to lose a sense of personal ownership or to lessen peer ownership.},

We define crowdsourcing as an approach to problem solving which involves an organization having a large group attempt to solve a problem or part of a problem, then sharing solutions. Crowdsourcing allows large groups of individuals to participate in medical research through innovation challenges, hackathons, and related activities. The purpose of this literature review is to examine the definition, concepts, and applications of crowdsourcing in medicine. This multi-disciplinary review defines crowdsourcing for medicine, identifies conceptual antecedents (collective intelligence and open source models), and explores implications of the approach. Several critiques of crowdsourcing are also examined. Although several crowdsourcing definitions exist, there are two essential elements: (1) having a large group of individuals, including those with skills and those without skills, propose potential solutions; (2) sharing solutions through implementation or open access materials. The public can be a central force in contributing to formative, pre-clinical, and clinical research. A growing evidence base suggests that crowdsourcing in medicine can result in high-quality outcomes, broad community engagement, and more open science.},

	abstract = {Background
Using checklists to critically evaluate and report qualitative research is a common practice in the health sciences and there is currently a plethora of checklists available. One strategy for developing such checklists is to identify and amalgamate items from previous checklists into more comprehensive, consolidated ones.
Objective
This paper aims to critically review the credibility of a widely endorsed checklist of this type, the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ), by replicating the procedures that led to the consolidation of its 32 items. The original development of COREQ consisted of four phases: 1. A literature search and identification of a sample (n=22) of references, 2. Data extraction through coding the references, 3. A simplification of an intermediate list of items, and 4. Addition of two items.
Design and methods
A replication of the four-phased development of COREQ. We used the reported account of the development of COREQ to replicate the procedures and rationale applied in the four phases. However, we were rarely able to replicate them completely because of uncertainty about the actual procedures. The problems with the replication indicated that COREQ's items were not credible because the coding processes were not trustworthy and because they decontextualized original checklist items and significantly distorted their meaning in COREQ's final list of items. We discuss the use of checklists by means of Haraway's figure of the “modest witness”, which emphasises that checklists can de-politicise research and create an illusion of rationality and objectivity.
Conclusions
Considering that COREQ is widely endorsed by scholarly journals, it is alarming that the checklist's particular technical and a-political approach to achieve more complete reporting of qualitative research and its particular perspective on what constitutes quality in qualitative research remains unchallenged.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: For many years it has been claimed that observational studies find stronger treatment effects than randomized, controlled trials. We compared the results of observational studies with those of randomized, controlled trials.
METHODS: We searched the Abridged Index Medicus and Cochrane data bases to identify observational studies reported between 1985 and 1998 that compared two or more treatments or interventions for the same condition. We then searched the Medline and Cochrane data bases to identify all the randomized, controlled trials and observational studies comparing the same treatments for these conditions. For each treatment, the magnitudes of the effects in the various observational studies were combined by the Mantel-Haenszel or weighted analysis-of-variance procedure and then compared with the combined magnitude of the effects in the randomized, controlled trials that evaluated the same treatment.
RESULTS: There were 136 reports about 19 diverse treatments, such as calcium-channel-blocker therapy for coronary artery disease, appendectomy, and interventions for subfertility. In most cases, the estimates of the treatment effects from observational studies and randomized, controlled trials were similar. In only 2 of the 19 analyses of treatment effects did the combined magnitude of the effect in observational studies lie outside the 95 percent confidence interval for the combined magnitude in the randomized, controlled trials.
CONCLUSIONS: We found little evidence that estimates of treatment effects in observational studies reported after 1984 are either consistently larger than or qualitatively different from those obtained in randomized, controlled trials.},

Design Anonymous questionnaire survey developed for this purpose. Setting Zagreb University School of Medicine, Croatia. Participants A total of 932 students (response rate 58\%) from all 6 years were invited to participate. Main outcome measures Score on attitude scale with 45 Likert-type statements and score on knowledge test consisting of 8 multiple choice questions. Results The average attitude score for all students was 166 ± 22 out of a maximum of 225, indicating a positive attitude towards science and scientific research. The students' average score on the knowledge test was 3.2 ± 1.7 on 8 questions. Students who had finished Year 2 had the highest mean attitude (173 ± 24) and knowledge (4.7 ± 1.7) scores compared with other year groups (P {\textless} 0.001, anova and Tukey posthoc test). For students who had attended a mandatory Year 2 course on the principles of scientific research in medicine (Years 3 to 6), multiple linear regression analysis showed that knowledge test score (B = 3.4; SE = 0.4; 95\% confidence interval 2.5–4.2; P {\textless} 0.001) and average grades (B = 7.6; SE = 1.5; 95\% CI 4.6–10.6; P {\textless} 0.001) were significant predictors of attitude towards science, but not sex or failure to pass a year (B = − 0.6; SE = 1.7; 95\% CI − 3.9–2.6; P = 0.707; and B = − 3.1; SE = 1.9; 95\% CI − 6.8–5.7; P = 0.097, respectively). Conclusion Medical students have generally positive attitudes towards science and scientific research in medicine. Attendance of a course on research methodology is related to a positive attitude towards science.},

	abstract = {Epidemiologists are often confronted with datasets to analyse which contain measurement error due to, for instance, mistaken data entries, inaccurate recordings and measurement instrument or procedural errors. If the effect of measurement error is misjudged, the data analyses are hampered and the validity of the study’s inferences may be affected. In this paper, we describe ﬁve myths that contribute to misjudgments about measurement error, regarding expected structure, impact and solutions to mitigate the problems resulting from mismeasurements. The aim is to clarify these measurement error misconceptions. We show that the inﬂuence of measurement error in an epidemiological data analysis can play out in ways that go beyond simple heuristics, such as heuristics about whether or not to expect attenuation of the effect estimates. Whereas we encourage epidemiologists to deliberate about the structure and potential impact of measurement error in their analyses, we also recommend exercising restraint when making claims about the magnitude or even direction of effect of measurement error if not accompanied by statistical measurement error corrections or quantitative bias analysis. Suggestions for alleviating the problems or investigating the structure and magnitude of measurement error are given.},

	abstract = {Three experiments were conducted within the framework of correspondent inference theory. In each of the experiments the subjects were instructed to estimate the “true” attitude of a target person after having either read or listened to a speech by him expressing opinions on a controversial topic. Independent variables included position of speech (pro, anti, or equivocal), choice of position vs. assignment of position, and reference group of target person. The major hypothesis (which was confirmed with varying strength in all three experiments) was that choice would make a greater difference when there was a low prior probability of someone taking the position expressed in the speech. Other findings of interest were: (1) a tendency to attribute attitude in line with behavior, even in no-choice conditions; (2) increased inter-individual variability in conditions where low probability opinions were expressed in a constraining context; (3) that this variability was partly a function of the subjects' own attitudes on the issue; (4) that equivocation in no-choice conditions leads to the attribution that the equivocator opposes the assigned position. The main conclusion suggested is that perceivers do take account of prior probabilities and situational constraints when attributing private attitude, but perhaps do not weight these factors as heavily as would be expected by a rational analysis.},

Forty-eight percent of journals made no use of these policies. Improving the use of reporting guidelines will improve research for all stakeholders. Summary Background Reporting guidelines and trial/review registration policies have been instituted in order to minimize bias and improve research practices. Objective The objective of this study was to investigate the policies of hematology journals concerning reporting guideline adoption and trial/review registration. Methods We performed a web-based data abstraction from the Instructions for Authors of 67 hematology journals catalogued in the Expanded Science Citation Index of the 2014 Journal Citation Reports to identify whether each journal required, recommended or made no mention of the following reporting guidelines: EQUATOR, ICMJE, CONSORT, MOOSE, QUOROM, PRISMA, STARD, STROBE, ARRIVE and CARE. We also extracted whether journals required or recommended trial or systematic review registration. We e-mailed editors three times to determine which types of studies their journal accepts. Results Forty-eight per cent (32/67) of hematology journals do not adhere to any reporting guidelines. For responding journals, the QUOROM statement, MOOSE, CARE and PROSPERO were the least often mentioned, whereas the ICMJE guidelines, CONSORT statement and general trial registration were most often mentioned. Discussion Reporting guidelines are infrequently required or recommended by hematology journals. Furthermore, few require clinical trial or systematic review database registration. A higher rate of adherence to reporting guidelines can prevent bias from entering the literature. Participation from all stakeholders, including authors and journal editors, to improve reporting guideline and policy practices is required.},

	abstract = {Objective This study investigated the policies of cardiac and cardiovascular system journals concerning clinical trial registration and guideline adoption to understand how frequently journals use these mechanisms to improve transparency, trial reporting and overall study quality.
Methods We selected the top 20 (by impact factor) journals cited in the subcategory ‘Cardiac and Cardiovascular Systems’ of the Expanded Science Citation Index of the 2014 Journal Citation Reports to extract journal policies concerning the 17 guidelines we identified. In addition, trial and systematic review registration adherence statements were extracted. 300 randomised controlled trials published in 2016 in the top 20 journals were searched for clinical trial registry numbers and CONSORT diagrams.
Results Of the 19 cardiac and cardiovascular system journals included in our analysis, eight journals (42\%) did not require or recommend trial or review registration. Seven (37\%) did not recommend or require a single guideline within their instructions to authors. Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials guidelines (10/19, 53\%) were recommended or required most often. Of the trials surveyed, 122/285 (42.8\%) published a CONSORT diagram in their manuscript, while 236/292 (80.8\%) published a trial registry number.
Discussion Cardiac and cardiovascular system journals infrequently require, recommend or enforce the use of reporting guidelines. Furthermore, too few require or enforce the use of clinical trial registration. Cardiology journal editors should consider guideline adoption due to their potential to limit bias and increase transparency.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Reporting guidelines (RG) aim to improve research transparency and ensure high-quality study reporting. Similarly, clinical trial registration policies aim to reduce bias in results reporting by ensuring prospective registration of all trial outcomes. Failure to adhere to quality standards documented in RGs may result in low-quality and irreproducible research. Herein, we investigate the adherence to common RGs and trial registration policies in 21 oncology journals. We surveyed the Instructions for Authors page for each of the included oncology journals for adherence to common reporting guidelines and trial registration policies. We corresponded with editors to determine accepted study types and cross-referenced this information with a journal’s RGs and trial registration policies to calculate the per cent of journals that adhere to a specific guideline or policy. 76.2\% (16/21) of oncology journals surveyed adhere to Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines for clinical trials while only 33.3\% (7/21) adhere to Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology for observational studies. Similarly, 76.2\% (16/21) of oncology journals adhere to clinical trial registration policies. We further demonstrate that journal adherence to RGs positively affects author reporting, despite adherence to trial registration policies showing no such benefit. Our results show that oncology journals adhere to RGs and trial registration policies at a higher rate than other specialties, but nonetheless show room for improvement. We conclude that oncology journal adherence to RGs and trial registration policies is encouraging, but nonetheless suboptimal. We recommend the adoption of RGs and trial registration policies by all oncology journals.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Aim: The objective of this study was to evaluate the current recommendations and requirements of gastroenterology and hepatology journals concerning reporting guidelines and clinical trial registration. Current research on the topic is sparse and in need of further research in both clinical trial registration and guideline adherence.
        Methods: The authors performed a review of journal protocols and ‘Instructions for Authors’ regarding guideline adherence and trial registration requirements within 30 gastroenterology and hepatology journals. We searched the Expanded Science Citation Index of the 2015 Journal Citation Reports to determine if each journal required, recommended, or made no mention of 17 guidelines and clinical trial registration.
        Results: A majority (23/30; 76.7\%) of the journals either required or recommended reporting guideline usage, whereas the remainder (7/30; 23.3\%) had no such policy. In addition, 14 (14/30; 46.7\%) require or recommend trial registration. Journals with a higher impact factor were associated with greater reporting guideline adherence (rpb = 0.43, P {\textless} 0.05). There was not a significant relationship between journal impact factor and trial registration requirements (rpb = 0.16, P {\textgreater} 0.05). Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials was the most often required guideline (9/30; 30\%), whereas Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses were tied for second most often required (6/30 each; 20\% each). Clinical trial registration was most common via ClinicalTrials.gov (9/30; 30\%).
        Conclusion: A majority of gastroenterology or hepatology journals either require or recommend reporting guideline usage, but just less than one-half of the journals did the same for trial registration.},
