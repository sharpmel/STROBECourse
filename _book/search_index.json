Epidemiology, the study of diseases and population health, is a broad field with ever-changing methods and often heated debates about proper designs, analyses, and approaches. Therefore, we think it is important that there is a place where epidemiologists can share their knowledge in an open and transparent manner. Drawing inspiration from the #epitwitter community and the Open Science Massive Online Course, we hope that this will become a living site which can be used and modified by the epidemiology community and those interested in sharing epidemiological knowledge in accessible ways. This site is uses the R Bookdown package, which is built using R Markdown. All content is stored in the GitHub repository of Melissa Sharp, a doctoral student working on observational research methods. Please contact her if you have any comments, questions, or concerns. Structure We aim to be as inclusive as possible but are structuring this book on the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline. STROBE was created in 2007 and is comprised of a 22-item checklist of essential items to report when discussing the results from a cohort, cross-sectional, or case-control study (1,2). It has been endorsed by the International Commitee of Journal Editors and hundreds of journals and has spawned at least another 13 field- or -method specific extensions. (3–15) Figure 1: STROBE Checklist STROBE and this book follows the IMRaD (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) style of reporting research and we will cover the important items that authors must think and write about when discussing their research. The intial content will be largely guided by information from Content STROBE’s Explanation and Elaboration document (2) which gives examples of “good reporting” and briefly explains each checklist item. Additional information will be supplied from the dissertation of Melissa Sharp and projects contained within, particularly results from a qualitative assessment of the content in the STROBE Extensions. (16) Content is designed in a modular format that is aligned with the design of the STROBE Checklist. - If you are familiar with epidemiological research methods, you can pick and choose what items to explore. - Otherwise, if you are unexperienced, you can follow the course in a more linear fashion, beginning with an introduction on the concept of reporting guidelines and their use. Audience The content on this book will appeal to those who work in observational research, need a refresher on certain epidemiological topics, or want to improve their scientific writing skills. Some baseline understanding of clinical or public health research may be helpful, although we do not require prior knowledge or experience in research in order to take this course. That being said, epidemiology is extremely extensive. Critical thinking and proper analytical skills need to be developed and honed over time. Content We hope to help you develop your understanding of study designs, data collection, statistical analysis, and interpretation of results. This site will not cover key aspects of the conduct of research, such as the skills needed for personal interactions with patients and participants, detailed analytical skills, regulatory frameworks, nor science communication skills needed to disseminate your work to the general public. All are important areas influencing items covered in this course but the breadth is too great to go over each area in depth. Rather, we aim to provide supplementary information along the way that will help you explore and grow in these areas if you so wish.

["observational-studies.html", "Observational Studies Why STROBE? General Writing Advice", " Observational Studies Careful design and analysis of observational studies is essential because they cannot control for certain external factors, thus they are especially prone to bias and confounding [37]. In an ideal world, people would be able to use randomized control trials more often, however, sometimes it is simply unethical or impractical to conduct an RCT. For example, when investigating socioeconomic impacts on health or surgical procedures. Due to the complex design and conduct of observational studies, they have been deemed to be “the most necessary and difficult” studies to conduct [38]. Observational studies are conducted in real-world settings and can investigate the impact of health policies on populations and explore the distribution of health outcomes across groups. RCTs simply cannot achieve these same results. Observational research also allows participants to be followed for longer periods of time meaning that one can evaluate changes in health outcomes throughout the lifespan. Furthermore, observational studies affordably provide a larger number of participants in comparison to RCTs. This allows investigations into differences between subgroups in the population (e.g., different age groups, disease subtypes). Given the breadth of topics that observational studies can cover, it is no surprise that it is the most common study design used in biomedical research [27–30]. Why STROBE? Due to a high prevalence of observational studies in the literature, widespread poor reporting means that an enormous amount of the medical literature has issues. Research has shown that items concerning the methodology and results of observational studies are particularly poorly reported [39–44]. Details about participants, data collection, and analyses are common problems. Missing details on how many people were eligible to participate, consented, and lost to follow-up questions the generalizability of results. Whereas, missing data, the reliability of the data collection instruments used, how the data was analyzed, and missing disclosures of funding sources can be worrying as motives for certain narratives or results may be hidden. Therefore, a reporting guideline for observational research is critically needed to reinforce replicability and reproducibility and instill greater confidence in the trustworthiness of results. General Writing Advice general writing guidance (watch causal language, do not spin your results, etc.). (17) References "],
["intro-title-and-abstract.html", "Intro: Title and abstract", " Intro: Title and abstract The items from STROBE state that you should report: - Indicate the study’s design with a commonly used term in the title or the abstract; AND - Provide in the abstract, an informative and balanced summary of what was done and what was found First and foremost, thoughtful consideration must be given to the title of your work and the abstract. Based on which journal you plan on submitting your work to, they might provide restrictions on how many words you can use, so be as concise and unambiguous as possible. Yes, you are trying to sell your work but tell the truth, do not spin your results to make them seem like they are more than they are. Science is a search for the truth. Try to be as objective as possible and frame your findings correctly. Although this is the first item in the checklist, some people find that it is the easiest to write these at or near the end of your work as it contains the key messages that you want to focus on. Explanation (2) &gt; Readers should be able to easily identify the design that was used from the title or abstract. An explicit, commonly used term for the study design also helps ensure correct indexing of articles in electronic databases.19,20 Some key items to consider adding: - The study design (e.g., cohort, cross-sectional, case-control). - Information about the data source (e.g., bibliometric, patient registry, etc.) - Information about the timing of data collection (e.g., longitudinal, date ranges) - The main results (e.g., “found high rates of x”, \" ) Example structures - “Key finding/exposures” among/in “sample/population” during “time period of study/data collection” : “study design” - “Study design” investigating “exposures” among “sample/population” during “time period of study/data collection” found “key findings” Examples of Good Reporting - “Leukemia incidence among workers in the shoe and boot manufacturing industry: a case-control study” (???,2) - “The consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages was derived from 7 repeated FFQs administered between 1980 and 2002” (9,18) Field-specific guidance: Infectious disease molecular epidemiology (6) - The term molecular epidemiology should be applied to the study in the title or abstract and the keywords when molecular and epidemiological methods contribute substantially to the study Molecular epidemiology (8) - State the use of speciﬁc biomarker(s) in the title and ⁄or in the abstract if they contribute substantially to the ﬁndings Nutritional data (10) - State the dietary/nutritional assessment method(s) used in the title, abstract, or keywords Response-driven sampling (14) - Indicate “respondent-driven sampling” in the title or abstract Routinely collected health data (3) - The type of data used should be speciﬁed in the title or abstract. When possible, the name of the databases used should be included - If applicable, the geographic region and time frame within which the study took place should be reported in the title or abstract - If linkage between databases was conducted for the study, this should be clearly stated in the title or abstract Serology (7) - The term “seroepidemiologic,” “seroepidemiology,” “seroprevalence,” or “seroincidence” should be applied to the study in the title or abstract, and the medical subject heading “Seroepidemiologic Studies” be used when the report is of a population-based serological survey Simulation-based research (4) - In abstract or key terms, the MESH or searchable keyword term must have the word simulation or simulated References "],

["frequently-asked-questions-faq.html", "Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)", " Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) How can I contribute? There are three main ways that you can contribute. If you know RMarkdown and GitHub you can contribute directly via GitHub pull requests. Basically, navigate to the Rmd file that you want to change, edit the content, and submit the changes for approval. The repository owner Melissa Sharp will choose to integrate your comments by merging the changes into a new version. Each page should also be set up with a Disqus comment section where you can share any comments, concerns, or questions. If you don’t have a Disqus account already, you may need to make one prior to commenting. Lastly, the main author is reachable via e-mail or Twitter. When contact is made via these mechanisms it will be reported as such in the documentation. How is the book merged/compiled? The book uses a “Merge and Knit” approach which runs all code chunks in all chapters in the same R session. This allows objects created in previous chapters to be used in later chapters. (https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/new-session.html) Why are the pages blank when I try to knit the book? If there is an issue in your page’s code, the book will appear to continue processing the pages afterwards but they will be blank and 0kb. Find the error in the last page that contains information and fix it. Then you should be able to reknit and the other pages will show up. Can I suggest a resource/reference? Similar to editing other files in the repository, you can propose edits to the .bib file. After a reference is added to the bib file, the reference can then be cited in the Rmd files. Each citation has a key which is composed of: @ and a citation identifier (e.g., @ name year). Common types of additions are: @ article, book, misc (like websites), and techreport. Note: Please do not use non-English characters if you are editing the .bib file. In the R Markdown files, citations go inside square brackets and are separated by semicolons. In text, citations should be written as: TEXT TEXT [ @ smith2001; @ smith2002, ch. 1 ] A minus sign ( - ) before the @ will suppress mention of the author in the citation. This can be useful when the author is already mentioned in the text. (e.g., Research from Smith et al. found… ) Can I download the references? Yes! You can download the .bib file if you would like and import it into your reference software manager. I’m having difficulties formatting the text The basics of text formatting in RMarkdown can be found here: https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-syntax.html "],
