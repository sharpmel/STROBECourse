	abstract = {Survival analysis has found widespread applications in medicine in the last 10-15 years. However, there has been no published review of the use and presentation of survival analyses. We have carried out a systematic review of the research papers published between October and December 1991 in five clinical oncology journals. A total of 132 papers were reviewed. We looked at several aspects of study design, data handling, analysis and presentation of the results. We found that almost half of the papers did not give any summary of length of follow-up; that in 62\% of papers at least one end point was not clearly defined; and that both logrank and multivariate analyses were frequently reported at most only as P-values [63/84 (75\%) and 22/47 (47\%) respectively]. Furthermore, although many studies were small, uncertainty of the estimates was rarely indicated [in 13/84 (15\%) logrank and 16/47 (34\%) multivariate results]. The procedure for categorisation of continuous variables in logrank analyses was explained in only 8/49 (16\%) papers. The quality of graphs was felt to be poor in 43/117 (37\%) papers which included at least one survival curve. To address some of the presentational inadequacies found in this review we include new suggested guidelines for the presentation of survival analyses in medical journals. These would complement the statistical guidelines recommended by several clinical oncology journals.},

	abstract = {Background: Time-series studies have shown short-term temporal associations between low levels of ambient particulate air pollution and adverse health effects. It is not known whether or to what extent this literature is affected by publication bias. Methods: We obtained effect estimates from time-series studies published up to January 2002. These were summarized and examined for funnel plot asymmetry. We compared summary estimates between single-city and prospective multicity studies. Using 1 multicity study, we examined the sensitivity of summary estimates to alternative lag selection policies. Results: We found evidence for publication bias among single-city studies of daily mortality, hospital admissions for chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), and incidence of cough symptom, but not for studies of lung function. Statistical correction for this bias reduced summary relative risk estimates for a 10 μg/m³ increment of particulate matter less than 10 μm aerodynamic diameter (PM₁₀) as follows: daily mortality from 1.006 to 1.005 and admissions for COPD from 1.013 to 1.011; and odds ratio for cough from 1.025 to 1.015. Analysis of results from a large multicity study suggested that selection of positive estimates from a range of lags could increase summary estimates for PM₁₀ and daily mortality by up to 130\% above those based on nondirectional approaches. Conclusion: We conclude that publication bias is present in single-city time-series studies of ambient particles. However, after correcting for publication bias statistically, associations between particles and adverse health effects remained positive and precisely estimated. Differential selection of positive lags may also inflate estimates.},

Methods: In rural South India 72 children with malnutrition were identified from a central register; 72 controls were matched for age, gender, and residence.
Results: Major depression in the postpartum period (OR 5.0, 95\% CI 1.0 to 24.0), current major depression (OR 3.2, 95\% CI 1.1 to 9.5), and low maternal intelligence (OR 3.8, 95\% CI 1.3 to 11.1) were associated with malnutrition in the child. Low birth weight (OR 2.9, 95\% CI 1.2 to 6.8) was also significantly associated with infant malnutrition. Conditional logistic regression adjusting for all other determinants yielded the following results: major depression during the postpartum period (OR 7.8; 95\% CI 1.6 to 38.51), current major depression (OR 3.1; 95\% CI 0.9 to 9.7), low maternal intelligence (OR 4.6; 95\% CI 1.5 to 14.1), and low birth weight (OR 2.7; 95\% CI 2.5 to 6.8). The interactions between current maternal depression and low birth weight and between postpartum depression and low maternal intelligence were statistically significant. The level of maternal intelligence was associated with nutritional status. The severity of malnutrition was also significantly associated with major depression during the postpartum period and low maternal intelligence.
Conclusion: There is evidence for an association between postpartum maternal depression, low maternal intelligence, and low birth weight with malnutrition in children aged 6–12 months.},

	abstract = {Rubin's multiple imputation is a three-step method for handling complex missing data, or more generally, incomplete-data problems, which arise frequently in medical studies. At the first step, m ({\textgreater} 1) completed-data sets are created by imputing the unobserved data m times using m independent draws from an imputation model, which is constructed to reasonably approximate the true distributional relationship between the unobserved data and the available information, and thus reduce potentially very serious nonresponse bias due to systematic difference between the observed data and the unobserved ones. At the second step, m complete-data analyses are performed by treating each completed-data set as a real complete-data set, and thus standard complete-data procedures and software can be utilized directly. At the third step, the results from the m complete-data analyses are combined in a simple, appropriate way to obtain the so-called repeated-imputation inference, which properly takes into account the uncertainty in the imputed values. This paper reviews three applications of Rubin's method that are directly relevant for medical studies. The first is about estimating the reporting delay in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) surveillance systems for the purpose of estimating survival time after AIDS diagnosis. The second focuses on the issue of missing data and noncompliance in randomized experiments, where a school choice experiment is used as an illustration. The third looks at handling nonresponse in United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). The emphasis of our review is on the building of imputation models (i.e. the first step), which is the most fundamental aspect of the method.},

	abstract = {The Center for Indoor Air Research (CIAR) was created by three United States tobacco companies in 1988. Its stated mission is to fund high-quality, objective research related to indoor air, including studies of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Because CIAR is financed by the tobacco industry and funds research related to tobacco, it fosters an inherent conflict of interest. We consider whether this conflict of interest has affected the content, quality, or use of research funded by CIAR. We hypothesize that the tobacco industry might be using CIAR to develop scientific data to support its position that ETS is not harmful to health. CIAR funds two types of projects: "Peer-reviewed" projects are awarded after peer review by a group of scientists, whereas "special-reviewed" projects are awarded directly by tobacco industry executives. CIAR's special-reviewed projects are more likely than its peer-reviewed projects to be related to ETS, to support the tobacco industry position, and to be used by the industry to argue that smoking should not be regulated in public places. Our findings suggest that the tobacco industry is funding special-reviewed projects through CIAR to develop scientific data that it can use in legislative and legal settings. The industry may be financing peer-reviewed projects through CIAR to enhance its credibility, to provide good publicity, and to divert attention from ETS as an indoor air pollutant. CIAR's stated mission of funding high-quality, objective research has been compromised by conflict of interest, and at least some of CIAR's projects are being used to promote the tobacco industry's agenda.},

Articles were excluded if they did not focus specifically on the health effects of passive smoking or if they were not written in English.Data Extraction.—Review article quality was evaluated by 2 independent assessors who were trained, followed a written protocol, had no disclosed conflicts of interest, and were blinded to all study hypotheses and identifying characteristics of articles. Article conclusions were categorized by the 2 assessors and by one of the authors. Author affiliation was classified as either tobacco industry affiliated or not, based on whether the authors were known to have received funding from or participated in activities sponsored by the tobacco industry. Other article characteristics were classified by one of the authors using predefined criteria.Data Synthesis.—A total of 106 reviews were identified. Overall, 37\% (39/106) of reviews concluded that passive smoking is not harmful to health; 74\% (29/39) of these were written by authors with tobacco industry affiliations. In multiple logistic regression analyses controlling for article quality, peer review status, article topic, and year of publication, the only factor associated with concluding that passive smoking is not harmful was whether an author was affiliated with the tobacco industry (odds ratio, 88.4; 95\% confidence interval, 16.4-476.5; P\&lt;.001).Conclusions.—The conclusions of review articles are strongly associated with the affiliations of their authors. Authors of review articles should disclose potential financial conflicts of interest, and readers of review articles should consider authors' affiliations when deciding how to judge an article's conclusions.},

Residual confounding and a newly suggested parameter, the relative residual confounding, are defined on the regression parameters of the models. The estimator gives the proportion of confounding which has been removed by incomplete adjustment. The concept quantifies the effects of categorizing continuous covariables and of model misspecification. These are investigated by a simulation study and with data from an epidemiological investigation. A case-control study of laryngeal cancer is used to illustrate the residual confounding effect of arbitrary transformation of a continuous confounder, smoking, on the effect of alcohol consumption on laryngeal cancer risk. The data also showed that categorization into two levels can yield high residual confounding. The parameters described in this paper are of some use in quantifying the effect of inadequate adjustment for confounding variables.},

A total of 1664 citations were screened, 144 potentially eligible full articles were retrieved, and 37 studies met our inclusion criteria.Data ExtractionOne investigator (J.E.B.) extracted data from each of the 37 studies. The main outcomes were the prevalence of specific types of industry relationships, the relation between industry sponsorship and study outcome or investigator behavior, and the process for disclosure, review, and management of financial conflicts of interest.Data SynthesisApproximately one fourth of investigators have industry affiliations, and roughly two thirds of academic institutions hold equity in start-ups that sponsor research performed at the same institutions. Eight articles, which together evaluated 1140 original studies, assessed the relation between industry sponsorship and outcome in original research. Aggregating the results of these articles showed a statistically significant association between industry sponsorship and pro-industry conclusions (pooled Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio, 3.60; 95\% confidence interval, 2.63-4.91). Industry sponsorship was also associated with restrictions on publication and data sharing. The approach to managing financial conflicts varied substantially across academic institutions and peer-reviewed journals.ConclusionsFinancial relationships among industry, scientific investigators, and academic institutions are widespread. Conflicts of interest arising from these ties can influence biomedical research in important ways.},

The rapid evolution and availability of these data have revealed issues not addressed by existing reporting guidelines, such as Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE). The REporting of studies Conducted using Observational Routinely collected health Data (RECORD) statement was created to fill these gaps. RECORD was created as an extension to the STROBE statement to address reporting items specific to observational studies using routinely collected health data. RECORD consists of a checklist of 13 items related to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion section of articles, and other information required for inclusion in such research reports. This document contains the checklist and explanatory and elaboration information to enhance the use of the checklist. Examples of good reporting for each RECORD checklist item are also included herein. This document, as well as the accompanying website and message board (http://www.record-statement.org), will enhance the implementation and understanding of RECORD. Through implementation of RECORD, authors, journals editors, and peer reviewers can encourage transparency of research reporting.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}When using observational data, quantifying the effect of treatment duration on survival outcomes is not straightforward because only people who live for a long time can receive treatment for a long time. This problem doesn't apply to randomised trials because people are classified based on the treatment duration they are assigned, rather than the treatment duration that they achieve. This approach accepts that dead people do not deviate from their assigned treatment strategy. By transferring this insight to the analysis of observational data, we can follow three steps to estimate the effect of treatment duration from observational data without the bias of naive comparisons between long term and short term users. The first step is cloning people to assign them to multiple treatment strategies. The second step is censoring clones when they deviate from their assigned treatment strategy. The third step is performing inverse probability weighting to adjust for the potential selection bias introduced by censoring. The procedure can be used to compare any treatment strategies that are sustained over time. Cloning, censoring, and weighting eliminates immortal time bias in the estimates of absolute and relative risk, which helps researchers focus their attention on other biases that may be present in observational analyses and are not so easily eliminated.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The application of biomarkers to cancer epidemiology should enhance the validity of exposure and outcome measurement, and strengthen the statistical association between exposure and diseases, thus reducing the possibility of random and systematic error. However, the use of biomarkers provides in turn new opportunities for bias and confounding. Small sample size is a limitation of many molecular epidemiology studies. Three major types of bias are recognized: selection bias, information bias (measurement error), and confounding. An important aspect of confounding is that biomarkers can be seen both as exposure and outcome. A second aspect of confounding lies in the role of the biological marker in the causal pathway between exposure and disease. Molecular epidemiology offers better opportunity for the elucidation of interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Genetic susceptibility studies should demonstrate the highest disease risk for exposed susceptible groups and the lowest risk for non-susceptible unexposed groups.},

	abstract = {Objective
To improve the accuracy and completeness of reporting of studies of diagnostic accuracy, to allow readers to assess the potential for bias in a study, and to evaluate a study's generalisability.

Methods
The Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) steering committee searched the literature to identify publications on the appropriate conduct and reporting of diagnostic studies and extracted potential items into an extensive list. Researchers, editors, and members of professional organisations shortened this list during a two day consensus meeting, with the goal of developing a checklist and a generic flow diagram for studies of diagnostic accuracy.

Results
The search for published guidelines about diagnostic research yielded 33 previously published checklists, from which we extracted a list of 75 potential items. At the consensus meeting, participants shortened the list to a 25 item checklist, by using evidence, whenever available. A prototype of a flow diagram provides information about the method of patient recruitment, the order of test execution, and the numbers of patients undergoing the test under evaluation and the reference standard, or both.

Conclusions
Evaluation of research depends on complete and accurate reporting. If medical journals adopt the STARD checklist and flow diagram, the quality of reporting of studies of diagnostic accuracy should improve to the advantage of clinicians, researchers, reviewers, journals, and the public.},

Parametric regression models, such as multiple logistic regression, are powerful tools to control for multiple covariates provided that the covariate-risk associations are correctly specified. Residual confounding may result, however, from inappropriate specification of the confounder-risk association. In this paper, we illustrate the order of magnitude of residual confounding that may occur with traditional approaches to control for continuous confounders in multiple logistic regression, such as inclusion of a single linear term or categorization of the confounder, under a variety of assumptions on the confounder-risk association. We show that inclusion of the confounder as a single linear term often provides satisfactory control for confounding even in situations in which the model assumptions are clearly violated. In contrast, categorization of the confounder may often lead to serious residual confounding if the number of categories is small. Alternative strategies to control for confounding, such as polynomial regression or linear spline regression, are a useful supplement to the more traditional approaches.},

Design Prospective cohort study investigating the association between work stress and the metabolic syndrome.
Participants 10 308 men and women, aged 35-55, employed in 20 London civil service departments at baseline (the Whitehall II study); follow-up was an average of 14 years.
Main outcome measures Work stress based on the iso-strain model, measured on four occasions (1985-99). Biological measures of the metabolic syndrome, based on the National Cholesterol Education Program definition, measured in 1997-9.
Results A dose-response relation was found between exposure to work stressors over 14 years and risk of the metabolic syndrome, independent of other relevant risk factors. Employees with chronic work stress (three or more exposures) were more than twice as likely to have the syndrome than those without work stress (odds ratio adjusted for age and employment grade 2.25, 95\% confidence interval 1.31 to 3.85).
Conclusions Stress at work is an important risk factor for the metabolic syndrome. The study provides evidence for the biological plausibility of the link between psychosocial stressors from everyday life and heart disease.},

	abstract = {When experimental designs are premature, impractical, or impossible, researchers must rely on statistical methods to adjust for potentially confounding effects. Such procedures, however, are quite fallible. We examine several errors that often follow the use of statistical adjustment. The first is inferring a factor is causal because it predicts an outcome even after "statistical control" for other factors. This inference is fallacious when (as usual) such control involves removing the linear contribution of imperfectly measured variables, or when some confounders remain unmeasured. The converse fallacy is inferring a factor is not causally important because its association with the outcome is attenuated or eliminated by the inclusion of covariates in the adjustment process. This attenuation may only reflect that the covariates treated as confounders are actually mediators (intermediates) and critical to the causal chain from the study factor to the study outcome. Other problems arise due to mismeasurement of the study factor or outcome, or because these study variables are only proxies for underlying constructs. Statistical adjustment serves a useful function, but it cannot transform observational studies into natural experiments, and involves far more subjective judgment than many users realize.

	abstract = {Information about the etiology of childhood myeloid leukemia is limited. A population-based nested case-control study of prenatal and neonatal risk factors for childhood myeloid leukemia was performed with the use of the Swedish National Cancer Register and the Swedish Birth Register. A total of 98 cases of myeloid leukemia were identified in successive birth cohorts from 1973 through 1989. From the Birth Register, five controls were matched to each case. Fourteen of the 98 cases with myeloid leukemia and none of the controls had Down syndrome [odds ratio (OR) = infinity; 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 21.0-infinity]. The risk for myeloid leukemia also increased among children who had physiological jaundice (OR = 2.5; 95\% CI = 1.2-5.0; children who had been treated with phototherapy (OR = 7.5; 95\% CI = 1.8-31.9); or who had been treated in an incubator (OR = 3.5; 95\% CI = 1.2-10.2). Excluding cases with Down syndrome, however, decreased these risks, so that their 95\% lower confidence interval included the no-effect value. Maternal age {\textless} 20 years old (OR = 2.5; 95\% CI = 1.1-6.0), hypertension (OR = 2.4; 95\% CI = 1.2-5.0), Cesarean section (OR = 2.5; 95\% CI = 1.3-4.9), maternal smoking (OR = 2.4; 95\% CI = 0.9-6.5), and being one of a multiple birth (OR = 3.6; 95\% CI = 1.1-11.3) increased the risk for myeloid leukemia among those without Down syndrome. When the analyses were repeated, by restricting the cases to those with acute myeloid leukemia, the risk associated with young maternal age declined and became nonsignificant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	abstract = {In some investigations, comparison of the means of a variate y in two study groups may be biased because y is related to a variable x whose distribution differs in the two groups. A frequently used device for trying to remove this bias is adjustment by subclassification. The range of x is divided into c subclasses. Weighted means of the subclass means of y are compared, using the same weights for each study group. The effectiveness of this procedure in removing bias depends on several factors, but for monotonic relations between y and x, an analytical approach suggests that for c = 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 the percentages of bias removed are roughly 64\%, 79\%, 86\%, 90\%, and 92\%, respectively. These figures should also serve as a guide when x is an ordered classification (e.g. none, slight, moderate, severe) that can be regarded as a grouping of an underlying continuous variable. The extent to which adjustment reduces the sampling error of the estimated difference between the y means is also examined. An interesting side result is that for x normal, the percentage reduction in the bias of \${\textbackslash}bar x\_2\$-\${\textbackslash}bar x\_1\$ due to adjustment equals the percentage reduction in its variance. Under a simple mathematical model, errors of measurement in x reduce the amount of bias removed to a fraction 1/(1 + h) of its value, where h is the ratio of the variance of the errors of measurement to the variance of the correct measurements. Since ordered classifications are often used because x is difficult to measure, h may be substantial in such cases, though more information is needed on the values of h that are typical in practice.},

But does matching always automatically "control" confounding and is it always as good a strategy as it seems? It is the intention of this review to shed light on these questions primarily through illustrative examples of the effects of matching on the validity of point estimates of the odds ratio between exposure and disease status in both types of study designs. It is seen that the results of matching are more or less in line with expectations in cohort studies, but that matching can lead to unexpected results in case-control studies. In a case-control study, confounding is not automatically controlled by matching per se; rather, matching and a statistical analysis that properly accounts for the matching are needed to obtain a valid estimate of effect in a case-control study design.},

A commonly disregarded alternative explanation, however, is that the second cancers were clinically "silent" discoveries found because of increased diagnostic detection procedures in patients known to have a first cancer. Such patients are more likely to receive intensive surveillance and technologic testing than the general population often used as a control group. In 43 recent reports of neoplastic multimorbidity, however, only five mentioned the problem of detection bias, and only one tried to eliminate it by using a suitable analytic comparison.

Suppose, however, that one is planning a study in which the participants' true exposure levels are unobservable. Instead, the analysis will be based on an imprecise surrogate measure that differs from true exposure by some non-negligible amount of measurement error. Sample size estimates for tests of association between the surrogate exposure measure and the outcome of interest may be misleading if they are based solely on the anticipated characteristics of the distribution of surrogate measures in the study population. We examine the accuracy of sample size estimates for cohort studies in which a continuous surrogate exposure measure is subject to either classical or Berkson measurement error. In particular, we evaluate the consequences of not adjusting the sample size estimation procedure for tests based on imprecise exposure measurements to account for anticipated differences between the distributions of the true exposure and the surrogate measure in the study population. As expected, failure to adjust for classical measurement error can lead to underestimation of the required sample size. Disregard of Berkson measurement error, however, can result in sample size estimates that exceed the actual number of participants required for tests of association between the outcome and the surrogate exposure measure. We illustrate this Berkson error effect by estimating sample size for a hypothetical cohort study that examines an association between childhood exposure to radioiodine and the development of thyroid neoplasms. © 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the extent to which confounding effects of covariates, which are not controlled for by matching in the design, may influence the sample size necessary for case-control studies. The quantitative calculations are performed for an age-matched case-control study on lung cancer and air pollution, and are based on different evaluation methods. For illustrative purposes attention is confined to a dichotomous risk factor and a single dichotomous covariate. By using the numerical values of a pilot study investigating lung cancer and air pollution, it turns out that the sample size required for detecting a relative risk as close as 1.15 to 1 is only slightly influenced by the strength of the association between confounder and risk factor for reasonable variations around our empirical values. On the other hand, sample size considerably increases with increasing relative risk of a confounder even when the association remains small. The sample size required for an individually matched analysis practically equals that for an age-stratified analysis when the relative risk of the covariate is one. With a relative risk greater than one, however, the size for a matched analysis exceeds that for a stratified analysis and the ratio between them increases with increasing relative risk.},

There were 422 live patients and 110 deceased patients of women with a myocardial infarction with data available. The adjusted odds ratio for exposure to second generation oral contraceptives and risk of death within 28 days of a myocardial infarction compared with no oral contraceptive use was raised (2.88, 95\% confidence interval 1.22-6.77), and this effect was not seen for other types of oral contraceptives including third generation oral contraceptive formulations. In absolute terms, between 47,000 and 71,000 women would have to be exposed to a second generation pill for one year to result in one extra death from myocardial infarction, and this risk applies mainly to smokers. The results suggest a slightly increased relative risk of death among those having a myocardial infarction associated with exposure to second generation oral contraceptives, but this represents a small absolute risk. Further work is required before any change in contraceptive practice should be advocated.},

In logistic regression analysis, overall completeness of reporting about flow of study participants was associated with publication of a flow diagram.ConclusionsFlow diagrams are associated with improved quality of reporting of randomized controlled trials. However, the structure of current flow diagrams is less than ideal. We propose a revised flow diagram that includes all important counts through the stages of parallel group trials.},

Spirometric assessment included forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) measurements.Results.—Fifty-three of 67 eligible bartenders were interviewed. At baseline, all 53 bartenders reported workplace ETS exposure. After the smoking ban, self-reported ETS exposure at work declined from a median of 28 to 2 hours per week (P\&lt;.001). Thirty-nine bartenders (74\%) initially reported respiratory symptoms. Of those symptomatic at baseline, 23 (59\%) no longer had symptoms at follow-up (P\&lt;.001). Forty-one bartenders (77\%) initially reported sensory irritation symptoms. At follow-up, 32 (78\%) of these subjects had resolution of symptoms (P\&lt;.001). After prohibition of workplace smoking, we observed improvement in mean FVC (0.189 L; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.082-0.296 L; 4.2\% change) and, to a lesser extent, mean FEV1 (0.039 L; 95\% CI, −0.030 to 0.107 L; 1.2\% change). Complete cessation of workplace ETS exposure (compared with continued exposure) was associated with improved mean FVC (0.287 L; 95\% CI, 0.088-0.486; 6.8\% change) and mean FEV1 (0.142 L; 95\% CI, 0.020-0.264 L; 4.5\% change), after controlling for personal smoking and recent upper respiratory tract infections.Conclusion.—Establishment of smoke-free bars and taverns was associated with a rapid improvement of respiratory health.},

	abstract = {The bias described by Berkson arises as a mathematical phenomenon, caused by the probabilistic union of different rates of hospitalization for people with different medical phenomena. When the concept is extended to case-control studies, these rates will occur as hd for people with the target disease, hc for people with the control condition, and he for the separate effect of exposure to the suspected etiologic agent. An algebraic analysis of patterns of hospitalization and case-control selection demonstrates that Berkson's bias will be avoided if both cases and controls are chosen from the community or if he = 0. When the cases are chosen from hospitalized patients, the odds ratio will be biased if, as in the usual clinical situation, he ≠ 0. The odds ratio will be falsely elevated if the control groups are chosen from a community population rather than from hospitalized patients, and falsely lowered if the controls are hospitalized patients who do not have the target disease. If the control groups are chosen from patients hospitalized with specific comparison conditions, the odds ratio will be falsely elevated or lowered, depending on the relative magnitudes of hd and hc. In Berkson's mathematical model, the probabilistic calculations depend on the assumption that each of the exposed or diseased clinical conditions has an independent additive effect on hospitalization rates. In reality, however, the concurrence of two or more conditions of disease and exposure may synergistically affect the examining physician's nosocomial decisions and may thereby substantially change the hospitalization rates from what is expected mathematically. In creating hospitalization bias in case-control studies, these selective clinical decisions about referral to hospital may be more cogent than the probabilistic distinctions described by Berkson.},

Neonatal infections are estimated to account for a quarter of the 2.8 million annual neonatal deaths, as well as approximately 3% of all disability-adjusted life-years. Despite this burden, few data are available on incidence, aetiology, and outcomes, particularly regarding impairment. We aimed to develop guidelines for improved scientific reporting of observational neonatal infection studies, to increase comparability and to strengthen research in this area. This checklist, Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology for Newborn Infection (STROBE- NI), is an extension of the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) statement. STROBE-NI was developed following systematic reviews of published literature (1996-2015), compilation of more than 130 potential reporting recommendations, and circulation of a survey to relevant professionals worldwide, eliciting responses from 147 professionals from 37 countries. An international consensus meeting of 18 participants (with expertise in infectious diseases, neonatology, microbiology, epidemiology, and statistics) identified priority recommendations for reporting, additional to the STROBE statement. Implementation of these STROBE-NI recommendations, and linked checklist, aims to improve scientific reporting of neonatal infection studies, increasing data utility and allowing meta-analyses and pathogen-specific burden estimates to inform global policy and new interventions, including maternal vaccines.},

	doi = {52882},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To classify and compare articles, based on the study design, in four leading US obstetrics and gynecology journals.
METHODS: One year of each journal, American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (AJOG), Obstetrics and Gynecology (O\&G), Gynecologic Oncology (GO), and Fertility and Sterility (F\&S), beginning May 1997, was reviewed. Supplementary issues were excluded from review. The percentage of articles devoted to observational versus experimental study design was determined, and the quality of evidence was assessed including how heavily randomized controlled trials were represented versus other study designs.
RESULTS: 1,517 articles were reviewed. The average percentage of clinical research articles was 90.4. The percentage of animal studies were 10.7 (AJOG), 1.1 (O\&G), 1.1 (GO) and 4.2 (F\&S) (chi(2) p {\textless} 0.001). There were 5.3, 1.9, 6.5, and 7.5\% basic science articles, respectively (chi(2) p = 0.007). The average percentage of observational articles was 68.2 and that of experimental articles was 14.1. The percentages of total articles classified as controlled experimental were 10.9 (AJOG), 14.6 (O\&G), 5.1 (GO), and 15.2 (F\&S) (chi(2) p = 0.01). There were 8.7, 11.1, 3.3 and 9.5\% randomized controlled trials, respectively (chi(2) p = 0.008).
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of research reviewed was clinical, and more than half of the articles were observational. Under the US Preventative Services Task Force rating system, the randomized control trial is given the highest rating - class I evidence. The drive toward evidence-based clinical practice may not be fully supported by researchers in obstetrics and gynecology, as reflected by submissions to and publications in the major obstetrics and gynecology journals.},

Consumption of SSBs was derived from 7 repeated food-frequency questionnaires administered between 1980 and 2002. Relative risks (RRs) for CHD were calculated by using Cox proportional hazards models and adjusted for known cardiovascular disease risk factors.
RESULTS: During 24 y of follow-up, we ascertained 3105 incident cases of CHD (nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal CHD). After standard and dietary risk factors were adjusted for, the RRs (and 95\% CIs) of CHD according to categories of cumulative average of SSB consumption ({\textless}1/mo, 1-4/mo, 2-6/wk, 1/d, and {\textgreater} or =2 servings/d) were 1.0, 0.96 (0.87, 1.06), 1.04 (0.95, 1.14), 1.23 (1.06, 1.43), and 1.35 (1.07, 1.69) (P for trend {\textless} 0.001). Additional adjustment for body mass index, energy intake, and incident diabetes attenuated the associations, but they remained significant. Artificially sweetened beverages were not associated with CHD.
CONCLUSION: Regular consumption of SSBs is associated with a higher risk of CHD in women, even after other unhealthful lifestyle or dietary factors are accounted for.},

The issues are illustrated in a sensitivity analysis of confounding in a study of residential wire code and childhood leukemia and in a pooled analysis of 12 studies of magnetic-field measurements and childhood leukemia. Both analyses have been interpreted as evidence in favor of a causal effect of magnetic fields on leukemia risk. This interpretation is contrasted with results from analyses based on prior distributions for the unidentified bias parameters used in the original sensitivity-analysis model. These analyses indicate that accounting for uncontrolled confounding and response bias under a reasonable prior can substantially alter inferences about the existence of a magnetic-field effect. More generally, analyses with informative priors for unidentified bias parameters can help avoid misinterpretation of conventional results and ordinary sensitivity analyses.},

A key problem is that there are no interpretations of these concepts that are at once simple, intuitive, correct, and foolproof. Instead, correct use and interpretation of these statistics requires an attention to detail which seems to tax the patience of working scientists. This high cognitive demand has led to an epidemic of shortcut definitions and interpretations that are simply wrong, sometimes disastrously and yet these misinterpretations dominate much of the scientific literature. In light of this problem, we provide definitions and a discussion of basic statistics that are more general and critical than typically found in traditional introductory expositions. Our goal is to provide a resource for instructors, researchers, and consumers of statistics whose knowledge of statistical theory and technique may be limited but who wish to avoid and spot misinterpretations. We emphasize how violation of often unstated analysis protocols (such as selecting analyses for presentation based on the P values they produce) can lead to small P values even if the declared test hypothesis is correct, and can lead to large P values even if that hypothesis is incorrect. We then provide an explanatory list of 25 misinterpretations of P values, confidence intervals, and power. We conclude with guidelines for improving statistical interpretation and reporting.},

	abstract = {Background
Atherosclerosis and sepsis share several pathophysiological similarities, including immune dysregulation, increased thrombogenesis, and systemic inflammation. The relation between statins and risk of sepsis in patients with atherosclerosis is unknown.
Methods
We did a population-based cohort analysis through linked administrative databases in Ontario, Canada, with accrual from 1997 to 2002. We identified 141,87 patients older than 65 years who had been hospitalised for an acute coronary syndrome, ischaemic stroke, or revascularisation, who survived for at least 3 months after discharge. 46,662 (33\%) were prescribed a statin within 90 days of discharge, 94,825 (67\%) were not. Propensity-based matching, which accounted for each individual's likelihood of receiving a statin, yielded a cohort of 69,168 patients, of whom half (34,584) received a statin and half (34,584) did not.
Findings
Incidence of sepsis was lower in patients receiving statins than in controls (71·2 vs 88·0 events per 10,000 person-years; hazard ratio [HR] 0·81; 95\% CI 0·72–0·91). Adjustment for demographic characteristics, sepsis risk factors, comorbidities, and health-care use gave similar results (HR 0·81; 95\% CI 0·72–0·90). The protective association between statins and sepsis persisted in high-risk subgroups, including patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, or a history of infections. Significant reductions in severe sepsis (HR 0·83; 95\% CI 0·70–0·97) and fatal sepsis (0·75; 0·61–0·93) were also observed. No benefit was noted with non-statin lipid-lowering agents (0·95; 0·75–1·22).
Implications
Use of statins in patients with atherosclerosis is associated with a reduced risk of subsequent sepsis. Randomised trials of statins for prevention of sepsis are warranted.},

	abstract = {Background: The incidence of end-stage renal disease is especially high in men, and some studies indicated that smoking is a risk factor for men only. We investigated associations between obesity, smoking, and physical inactivity and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the general population and whether risk for CKD was restricted to men. Methods: This was a cross-sectional health survey of the entire adult population of Nord-Trondelag County, Norway, 1995 to 1997, with a 70.6\% participation rate. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated in all subjects 20 years and older from calibrated serum creatinine levels by using the simplified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study formula, and CKD cases are defined as those with a GFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 ({\textless}0.75 mL/s). Results: A total of 30,485 men and 34,708 women were included, and prevalences of GFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 ({\textless}0.75 mL/s) were 0.8\% and 1.1\%, respectively. Age- and sex-adjusted logistic regression analyses showed dose-response relations for body mass index, smoking history, and physical activity. Relative risks were 1.77 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.47 to 2.14) for obesity (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2), 1.52 (95\% CI, 1.13 to 2.06) for smoking ({\textgreater}25 pack-years), and 2.14 (95\% CI, 1.39 to 3.30) for physical inactivity (no or some physical activity in leisure time). For subjects with all these risk factors, relative risk was 5.10 (95\% CI, 2.36 to 11.01). These results remained significant after adjusting for other known risk factors. No biological interactions between sex and obesity, smoking, or physical activity were found. Conclusion: Obesity, smoking, and physical inactivity were associated significantly with CKD. Men were not more susceptible to these risk factors than women.},

Design Population based case-control study with collection of personal interview data.
Setting Five areas of the United Kingdom.
Participants 966 people aged 18 to 69 years diagnosed with a glioma from 1 December 2000 to 29 February 2004 and 1716 controls randomly selected from general practitioner lists.
Main outcome measures Odds ratios for risk of glioma in relation to mobile phone use.
Results The overall odds ratio for regular phone use was 0.94 (95\% confidence interval 0.78 to 1.13). There was no relation for risk of glioma and time since first use, lifetime years of use, and cumulative number of calls and hours of use. A significant excess risk for reported phone use ipsilateral to the tumour (1.24, 1.02 to 1.52) was paralleled by a significant reduction in risk (0.75, 0.61 to 0.93) for contralateral use.
Conclusions Use of a mobile phone, either in the short or medium term, is not associated with an increased risk of glioma. This is consistent with most but not all published studies. The complementary positive and negative risks associated with ipsilateral and contralateral use of the phone in relation to the side of the tumour might be due to recall bias.},

	abstract = {Background

Population-based serologic studies are a vital tool for understanding the epidemiology of influenza and other respiratory viruses, including the early assessment of the transmissibility and severity of the 2009 influenza pandemic, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. However, interpretation of the results of serologic studies has been hampered by the diversity of approaches and the lack of standardized methods and reporting.


Objective

The objective of the CONSISE ROSES-I statement was to improve the quality and transparency of reporting of influenza seroepidemiologic studies and facilitate the assessment of the validity and generalizability of published results.


Methods

The ROSES-I statement was developed as an expert consensus of the CONSISE epidemiology and laboratory working groups. The recommendations are presented in the familiar format of a reporting guideline. Because seroepidemiologic studies are a specific type of observational epidemiology study, the ROSES-I statement is built upon the STROBE guidelines. As such, the ROSES-I statement should be seen as an extension of the STROBE guidelines.


Results

The ROSES-I statement presents 42 items that can be used as a checklist of the information that should be included in the results of published seroepidemiologic studies, and which can also serve as a guide to the items that need to be considered during study design and implementation.


Conclusions

We hope that the ROSES-I statement will contribute to improving the quality of reporting of seroepidemiologic studies.},

In the calendar year 1989, over 30\% of the articles published in the American Journal of Public Health employed some form of logistic regression modeling. In spite of this increase, there has been no commensurate increase in the use of commonly available methods for assessing model adequacy. METHODS. We review the current status of the use of logistic regression modeling in the American Journal of Public Health. We present a brief overview of currently available and easily used methods for assessing the adequacy of a fitted logistic regression model. RESULTS. An example is used to demonstrate the methods as well as a few of the adverse consequences of failing to assess the fit of the model. One important adverse consequence illustrated in the example is the inclusion of variables in the model as a result of the influence of one subject. CONCLUSIONS. Failure to address model adequacy may lead to misleading or incorrect inferences. Recommendations are made for the use of methods for assessing model adequacy and for future editorial policy in regard to the review of articles using logistic regression.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: There is concern regarding the possible health effects of cellular telephone use. We examined whether the source of funding of studies of the effects of low-level radiofrequency radiation is associated with the results of studies. We conducted a systematic review of studies of controlled exposure to radiofrequency radiation with health-related outcomes (electroencephalogram, cognitive or cardiovascular function, hormone levels, symptoms, and subjective well-being).
DATA SOURCES: We searched EMBASE, Medline, and a specialist database in February 2005 and scrutinized reference lists from relevant publications.
DATA EXTRACTION: Data on the source of funding, study design, methodologic quality, and other study characteristics were extracted. The primary outcome was the reporting of at least one statistically significant association between the exposure and a health-related outcome. Data were analyzed using logistic regression models.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Of 59 studies, 12 (20\%) were funded exclusively by the telecommunications industry, 11 (19\%) were funded by public agencies or charities, 14 (24\%) had mixed funding (including industry), and in 22 (37\%) the source of funding was not reported. Studies funded exclusively by industry reported the largest number of outcomes, but were least likely to report a statistically significant result: The odds ratio was 0.11 (95\% confidence interval, 0.02-0.78), compared with studies funded by public agencies or charities. This finding was not materially altered in analyses adjusted for the number of outcomes reported, study quality, and other factors.
CONCLUSIONS: The interpretation of results from studies of health effects of radiofrequency radiation should take sponsorship into account.},

	abstract = {The methodological discussion about matching when recruiting controls in case–control studies has been controversial for a long time. To delineate the impact of this discussion on the practice of matching we reviewed 266 case–control studies published in nine yearly volumes of three major epidemiological journals within the period 1955–1994. Among studies published until 1980 71.7\% of the control groups were recruited by individual matching compared to 46.4\% in 1994. This decline is paralleled by an increase in the application of frequency matching (from 5.0\% to 26.2\%). As the issue of matching is closely connected with methodological questions of the statistical analysis we also examined the type of analysis applied to the data. We found that the use of logistic regression modeling has dramatically increased during this period (from 18.4\% up to 87.2\%), whereas application of the traditional Mantel–Haenszel technique for estimating summary odds ratios has nearly vanished. The correct approach for individually matched data in the logistic modeling framework, the conditional likelihood technique, has been unknown in the early part of the time window of our investigation, but is even nowadays applied by only three quarters of the corresponding studies. Our literature-based investigation provides thus compelling evidence that the type of control selection and statistical analysis used in case–control studies have changed substantially during recent years.},

Results: For IVF-newborns, a high proportion of multiple births (27\%, odds ratio (OR) 19.67 compared with non-IVF births), low birth weight infants (30\%, OR 7.94), and perinatal deaths (2.9\%, OR 4.17) was found. The mothers' background did not explain the increased risks. After adjusting for gestation length and/or plurality, the odds ratios decreased significantly. Conclusion: Because of the high risk of plurality and premature births, matching the control group by gestation length and/or the number of multiples births may yield misleading results on the total health impact of IVF, and therefore it should be avoided.},

Fifty-four contributors listed on the bylines of the 10 articles were evaluated, and answers to questions were compared between contributors within research groups and against the published research report.ResultsA total of 36 (67\%) of 54 contributors replied to this survey. Important weaknesses were often admitted on direct questioning but were not included in the published article. Contributors frequently disagreed about the importance of their findings, implications, and directions for future research. I could find no effort to study systematically past evidence relating to the investigators' own findings in either survey responses or the published article. Overall, the diversity of contributor opinion was commonly excluded from the published report. I found that discussion sections were haphazardly organized and did not deal systematically with important questions about the study.ConclusionsA research paper rarely represents the opinions of those scientists whose work it reports. The findings described herein reveal evidence of (self-)censored criticism, obscured meanings, confused assessment of implications, and failures to indicate directions for future research. There is now empirical support for the introduction of structured discussion sections in research papers. Editors might also explore ways to recover the plurality of contributors' opinions.},

 abstract = {A large number of epidemiologic studies have focused on racial/ethnic differences, particularly between blacks and whites. Because health endpoints and racial categorizations are associated with socioeconomic status, investigators generally adjust for socioeconomic indicators. The intention is usually to control for confounding, thereby making groups comparable and excluding socioeconomic status as an alternative explanation to hypotheses of innate physiologic differences. A threat to the validity of these analyses is therefore the presence of residual confounding. We identify four potential sources of residual confounding in this analytical design: categorization of socioeconomic status variables, measurement error in socioeconomic indicators, use of aggregated socioeconomic status measures, and incommensurate socioeconomic indicators. Using simulations and examples from the literature, we demonstrate that the effect of residual confounding is to bias interpretation of data toward the conclusion of independent racial/ethnic group effects. Investigators often refer to possible "genetic" differences on the basis of models that control for socioeconomic status. We propose that such conclusions on the basis of this analytical strategy are generally unwarranted. Racial/ethnic differences in disease are a pressing public health concern, but the current approach does not often provide a basis for inference about putative biological factors in the etiology of this disparity.},

In positive studies, such a factor needs to be more prevalent in “high” wire codes than “low” whereas in negative studies, the factor should not be correlated to wire code. These concepts are quantified and we use these results to characterize potential factors that might explain the wire code–childhood leukemia association. We then re-evaluate findings from a survey of correlates of wire code in Connecticut with respect to potential for explaining the wire code–leukemia association. Under the presumption that the Connecticut correlations apply to the populations in which a wire code–leukemia association has been observed, only age and type of home are correlated enough to be potential explanatory factors. In particular, it appears very unlikely that traffic density can explain a significant portion of the wire code association. We suggest that correlation studies can be useful for identifying potential explanatory factors, but they must be done in regions where a wire code–childhood leukemia association has been observed.

Sensitivity analysis can provide such an assessment. Methods: We describe a method to reconstruct epidemiologic data, accounting for biases, and to display the results of repeated reconstructions as an assessment of error. We illustrate with a study of the effect of less-than-definitive therapy on breast cancer mortality. Results: We developed SAS code to reconstruct the data that would have been observed had a set of systematic errors been absent, and to convey the results. After 4,000 reconstructions of the example data, we obtained a median estimate of relative hazard equal to 1.5 with a 95\% simulation interval of 0.8-2.8. The relative hazard obtained by conventional analysis equaled 2.0, with a 95\% confidence interval of 1.2-3.4. Conclusions: Our method of sensitivity analysis can be used to quantify the systematic error for an estimate of effect and to describe that error in figures, tables, or text. In the example, the sources of error biased the conventional relative hazard away from the null, and that error was not accurately communicated by the conventional confidence interval.},

We demonstrate, using simulation and an example, that when the event of interest is captured outside of a study encounter (e.g., in a registry), person-time should be censored when the study-defined criterion for loss to follow-up is met (e.g., 1 year after last encounter), rather than at the last study encounter. Conversely, when the event of interest must be measured within the context of a study encounter (e.g., a biomarker value), person-time should be censored at the last study encounter. An inappropriate censoring scheme has the potential to result in substantial bias that may not be easily corrected.},

Methods Medline (January 1966 to December 2002) and Embase (January 1980 to December 2002) searches were supplemented with material identified in the references and in the authors' personal files. Data were independently abstracted by three of the authors and disagreements were resolved by consensus.
Results 30 studies were included. Research funded by drug companies was less likely to be published than research funded by other sources. Studies sponsored by pharmaceutical companies were more likely to have outcomes favouring the sponsor than were studies with other sponsors (odds ratio 4.05; 95\% confidence interval 2.98 to 5.51; 18 comparisons). None of the 13 studies that analysed methods reported that studies funded by industry was of poorer quality.
Conclusion Systematic bias favours products which are made by the company funding the research. Explanations include the selection of an inappropriate comparator to the product being investigated and publication bias.},

	volume = {29 Spec No},
	issn = {0149-2918},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In this era of evidence-based medicine, clinicians require a comprehensive range of well-designed studies to support prescribing decisions and patient management. In recent years, data from observational studies have become an increasingly important source of evidence because of improvements in observational-study methods and advances in statistical analysis.
OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the current literature and reports some of the key studies indicating that observational studies can both complement and build on the evidence base established by randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
METHODS: A literature search using the MEDLINE/ PubMed database (years: 1966-present) was carried out using the search terms observational or observational study(ies), historical control, nonrandomized, and postmarketing surveillance. All references comparing observational studies with randomized controlled trials were obtained and reviewed and were also hand-checked for studies not identified in the database searches.
RESULTS: Observational studies play an important role in investigating treatment outcomes. Data from large observational studies can clarify the tolerability profile of marketed medicines. In particular, observational studies can be of benefit in the study of large, heterogeneous patient populations with complex, chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus. Observational studies have played a key role in supporting the results of Phase III studies of insulin analogues for the treatment of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Future observational studies in the field of diabetes such as PREDICTIVE (Predictable Results and Experience in Diabetes through Intensification and Control to Target: an International Variability Evaluation) and IMPROVE will further our understanding of this global pandemic.
CONCLUSIONS: Well-designed observational studies can play a key role in supporting the evidence base for drugs and therapies. Current evidence suggests that observational studies can be conducted using the same exacting and rigorous standards as are used for RCTs. The observational study design should be considered as a complementary rather than a rival analytic technique.},

	abstract = {Purpose
The study aim is to assess confounding and effect measure modification of the relationship between head injury severity (measured using the Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS]) and mortality by age and multiple organ injury (measured using the Injury Severity Score [ISS]). Head injury–related mortality is affected by head injury severity, as well as age and multiple organ injury. However, little is known about the effect modification of these relationships.
Methods
Stratifications and multiple logistic regression analyses examined the association of mortality with GCS score less than 9, controlled for ISS of 16 and higher or age of 55 years and older. Receiver operating curve (ROC) analyses were used to explore the relationship of GCS cutoff values and prediction of death by the ISS and age categories mentioned.
Results
Both age and ISS modified head injury mortality in a similar direction: there was a negative interaction between age and ISS and more severe head injury. Lower GCS values (indicating more severe head injury) related more strongly to mortality in younger persons. Lower GCS values related more strongly to mortality when extracranial injuries were less severe. These data indicate effect modification. Data indicate negative confounding of the association between GCS and mortality by age and positive confounding by ISS. Multivariate analyses indicate that only younger age modifies the effect of more severe head injury with statistical significance when both age and multiple organ injury are considered. ROC analyses conducted with stratified and logistic regression analyses indicate that GCS is a better predictor of death in those with younger age.
Conclusions
The relationship of head injury severity and mortality is modified and confounded by age and ISS. GCS is a better predictor of death in younger patients.},

	abstract = {We propose a likelihood method for estimating parameters in generalized linear models with missing covariates and a non-ignorable missing data mechanism. In this paper, we focus on one missing covariate. We use a logistic model for the probability that the covariate is missing, and allow this probability to depend on the incomplete covariate. We allow the covariates, including the incomplete covariate, to be either categorical or continuous. We propose an EM algorithm in this case. For a missing categorical covariate, we derive a closed form expression for the E- and M-steps of the EM algorithm for obtaining the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs). For a missing continuous covariate, we use a Monte Carlo version of the EM algorithm to obtain the MLEs via the Gibbs sampler. The methodology is illustrated using an example from a breast cancer clinical trial in which time to disease progression is the outcome, and the incomplete covariate is a quality of life physical well-being score taken after the start of therapy. This score may be missing because the patients are sicker, so this covariate could be non-ignorably missing. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Design A case-crossover study.
Setting Perth, Western Australia.
Participants 456 drivers aged ≥ 17 years who owned or used mobile phones and had been involved in road crashes necessitating hospital attendance between April 2002 and July 2004.
Main outcome measure Driver's use of mobile phone at estimated time of crash and on trips at the same time of day in the week before the crash. Interviews with drivers in hospital and phone company's records of phone use.
Results Driver's use of a mobile phone up to 10 minutes before a crash was associated with a fourfold increased likelihood of crashing (odds ratio 4.1, 95\% confidence interval 2.2 to 7.7, P {\textless} 0.001). Risk was raised irrespective of whether or not a hands-free device was used (hands-free: 3.8, 1.8 to 8.0, P {\textless} 0.001; hand held: 4.9, 1.6 to 15.5, P = 0.003). Increased risk was similar in men and women and in drivers aged ≥ 30 and {\textless} 30 years. A third (n = 21) of calls before crashes and on trips during the previous week were reportedly on hand held phones.
Conclusions When drivers use a mobile phone there is an increased likelihood of a crash resulting in injury. Using a hands-free phone is not any safer.},

Design 42 placebo controlled studies of five selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors submitted to the Swedish drug regulatory authority as a basis for marketing approval for treating major depression were compared with the studies actually published (between 1983 and 1999).
Results Multiple publication: 21 studies contributed to at least two publications each, and three studies contributed to five publications. Selective publication: studies showing significant effects of drug were published as stand alone publications more often than studies with non-significant results. Selective reporting: many publications ignored the results of intention to treat analyses and reported the more favourable per protocol analyses only.
Conclusions The degree of multiple publication, selective publication, and selective reporting differed between products. Thus, any attempt to recommend a specific selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor from the publicly available data only is likely to be based on biased evidence.},

That goal can be achieved only through total transparency from authors. Despite several decades of educational efforts, the reporting of RCTs needs improvement. Investigators and editors developed the original CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement to help authors improve reporting by use of a checklist and flow diagram. The revised CONSORT statement presented here incorporates new evidence and addresses some criticisms of the original statement. The checklist items pertain to the content of the Title, Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion. The revised checklist includes 22 items selected because empirical evidence indicates that not reporting this information is associated with biased estimates of treatment effect, or because the information is essential to judge the reliability or relevance of the findings. We intended the flow diagram to depict the passage of participants through an RCT. The revised flow diagram depicts information from four stages of a trial (enrolment, intervention allocation, followup, and analysis). The diagram explicitly shows the number of participants, for each intervention group, included in the primary data analysis. Inclusion of these numbers allows the reader to judge whether the authors have done an intentionto- treat analysis. In sum, the CONSORT statement is intended to improve the reporting of an RCT, enabling readers to understand a trial's conduct and to assess the validity of its results.},

	abstract = {Purpose
The vast majority of epidemiological studies in cancer are observational. However, inadequate reporting of the published observational studies (OS) may restrict the generalizability and credibility of study results. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reporting quality of OS concerning cancer.
Methods
PubMed was searched for systematic reviews (SRs) of OS involving cancer published from January 2008 through February 2009. The citations provided in the SRs were evaluated for their reporting quality according to the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) statement, a checklist of items that are considered essential for good reporting of OS. The evaluation was focused on 25 methodological items/sub-items. The effect of journals' ranking in quality of reporting was also evaluated.
Results
The search identified 244 eligible OS included in seven SRs. Nine items/sub-items were reported by more than 90\% of studies and 16 items/sub-items were reported by more than 70\%. Some essential methodological aspects of OS (such as matching, absolute risks, missing data and flow diagram) were underreported. Significant differences were found among the seven SRs in the majority of the items. High and lower ranked journals were different only in reporting of results estimates and precision.
Conclusions
The quality of reporting in OS in cancer was considered satisfactory, although certain items were underreported. Further improvement of reporting may enhance the validity of observational research.},

	abstract = {Purpose
To study the relation between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and incident primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) in women.
Design
Prospective cohort analysis.
Participants
Seventy-six thousand three hundred eighteen women enrolled in the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS).
Methods
Women enrolled in the NHS from 1980 to 2000 were observed. Eligible participants were at least 40 years old, did not have POAG at baseline, and reported receiving eye examinations during follow-up. Potential confounders were assessed on biennial questionnaires, and a diagnosis of T2DM was confirmed on a validated supplemental questionnaire. During follow-up, 429 self-reported POAG cases confirmed by medical chart review were identified.
Main Outcome Measures
Multivariable rate ratios (RRs) of POAG and associated 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) obtained from proportional hazards models.
Results
After controlling for age, race, hypertension, body mass index, physical activity, alcohol intake, smoking, and family history of glaucoma, T2DM was positively associated with POAG (RR = 1.82 [95\% CI = 1.23–2.70]). Nonetheless, the association did not strengthen with longer duration of diabetes: RR = 2.24 (95\% CI = 1.31–3.84) for duration {\textless} 5 years versus RR = 1.54 (95\% CI = 0.90–2.62) for duration ≥ 5 years). In secondary analyses, to evaluate the potential for detection bias we controlled for additional factors such as the number of eye examinations, but T2DM remained positively associated with POAG.
Conclusion
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk of POAG in women.},

"Independent" relative risk estimates, for the effect of one exposure after adjusting for confounding exposures, may be biased in either direction, depending on the amount of measurement imprecision in the exposure of interest and in the confounders. We describe two methods which estimate the bias in multivariate relative risk estimates due to the effect of measurement imprecision in one or more of the exposure variables in the model. Results from the two methods are compared in an example involving HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and coronary heart disease. In this example, the degree of bias in relative risk estimates is shown to be highly dependent on the amount of measurement imprecision ascribed to the exposures. It is concluded that when two exposures are substantially correlated, and one or both is subject to sizeable measurement imprecision, a study in which exposures are measured only once will be inadequate for investigating the independent effect of the exposures. Where feasible, epidemiologists should seek study populations where the correlation between the exposures is smaller.},

It requires calculating and reporting the total uncertainty in the results, which in turn requires methods for quantifying the uncertainty introduced by systematic error. Quantified uncertainty can improve policy and clinical decisions, better direct further research, and aid public understanding, and thus enhance the contributions of epidemiology. The error quantification approach proposed here is based on estimating a probability distribution for a bias-corrected effect measure based on externally-derived distributions of bias levels. Using Monte Carlo simulation, corrections for multiple biases are combined by identifying the steps through which true causal effects become data, and (in reverse order) correcting for the errors introduced by each step. The bias-correction calculations are the same as those used in sensitivity analysis, but the resulting distribution of possible true values is more than a sensitivity analysis; it is a more complete reporting of the actual study results. The approach is illustrated with an application to a recent study that resulted in the drug, phenylpropanolamine, being removed from the market.},

Sample selection, participant refusal, and data quality received insufficient attention in many articles. Statistical analyses commonly used odds ratios (38 articles) and hazard/rate ratios (23), with some inconsistent use of terminology. Confidence intervals were reported in most studies (68), though use of P values was less common (38). Few articles explained their choice of confounding variables; many performed subgroup analyses claiming an effect modifier, though interaction tests were rare.

	abstract = {Background: Extremely-low-frequency magnetic field (ELF-MF) exposure is suspected to increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Such fields are present in the vicinity of electrical motors and other electric appliances containing coils. Methods: We investigated lifetime occupational ELF-MF exposure in relation to Alzheimer's disease and dementia among a community dementia-free cohort (n = 931) age 75 years and older in Stockholm, Sweden. This cohort was followed from 1987-1989 until 1994-1996 to detect dementia cases ("Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders," revised 3rd edition criteria). Information on lifetime job history was obtained by interview, usually of next of kin. ELF-MF exposure was assessed using a job-exposure matrix, measurement on historical equipment, and expert estimation. We analyzed the data with Cox models controlling for potential confounders. Results: Dementia was diagnosed in 265 subjects, including 202 with Alzheimer's disease. Among men, ELF-MF exposure ???0.2 ??T in lifetime principal job was related to multivariate-adjusted relative risks of 2.3 (95\% CI = 1.0-5.1) for Alzheimer's disease and 2.0 (1.1-3.7) for dementia. We found no association among women. A similar sex-specific pattern was seen for the associations with average ELF-MF exposure throughout the work life. A dose-response relation was suggested in men, with multivariate-adjusted relative risks of 2.4 (0.8-6.8) for Alzheimer's disease and 2.5 (1.1-5.6) for dementia for the upper tertile of lifetime average exposure. Conclusions: Long-term occupational exposure to a higher ELF-MF level may increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease and dementia in men. Similar patterns were not seen in women, which may in part be the result of a greater exposure misclassification in women than in men.},

They cautioned that the response bias problem has been neglected in mental health research at the price of substantial error. Have the cautions been heeded? Or does the neglect of response bias continue? Articles published in 1998 in three major psychiatric journals were examined: Archives of General Psychiatry, American Journal of Psychiatry, and the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease. The articles were examined to determine whether response biases were mentioned and whether systematic efforts were made to attend to their influence on the findings of the study. Each article was assessed twice by independent raters. The examination indicates that a very small minority of the articles reviewed mentioned response bias and that among those mentioning it, a minority attempted to control for bias effects. Cautions offered about response bias have not been heeded. Accordingly, the issue is one of how to incorporate concerns about response bias into the institutional structures that influence the culture of mental health research.},

	abstract = {Adjustments for making multiple comparisons in large bodies of data are recommended to avoid rejecting the null hypothesis too readily. Unfortunately, reducing the type I error for null associations increases the type II error for those associations that are not null. The theoretical basis for advocating a routine adjustment for multiple comparisons is the "universal null hypothesis" that "chance" serves as the first-order explanation for observed phenomena. This hypothesis undermines the basic premises of empirical research, which holds that nature follows regular laws that may be studied through observations. A policy of not making adjustments for multiple comparisons is preferable because it will lead to fewer errors of interpretation when the data under evaluation are not random numbers but actual observations on nature. Furthermore, scientists should not be so reluctant to explore leads that may turn out to be wrong that they penalize themselves by missing possibly important findings.},

STROBE has an ambitious goal, and may prove highly useful for some. It raises concern, however, about a problem generic to guidelines, namely how long they will be useful. Guidelines may be inevitable, but they can foster ossification and be counterproductive. Who today would be happy with epidemiology guidelines issued in, say, 1960, 1970, 1980, or even, 1990? One solution is to offer each set of guidelines with an expiration date, beyond which it would cease to apply. Such a policy would at least prompt revisions. We propose that the STROBE guidelines might expire on 31 December 2010 or 3 years after any revision.},

We propose a new class of inverse probability of censoring weighted estimators that are consistent and asymptotically normal (CAN) for estimating β0 when the non-response probabilities can be parametrically modelled and a CAN estimator exists. The proposed estimators do not require full specification of the likelihood and their computation does not require numerical integration. We show that the asymptotic variance of the optimal estimator in our class attains the semi-parametric variance bound for the model. In some models, no CAN estimator of β0 exists. We provide a general algorithm for determining when CAN estimators of β0 exist. Our results follow after specializing a general representation described in the article for the efficient score and the influence function of regular, asymptotically linear estimators in an arbitrary semi-parametric model with non-ignorable non-response in which the probability of observing complete data is bounded away from zero and the non-response probabilities can be parametrically modelled. © 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We argue that the simplicity achieved is gained at a cost; dichotomization may create rather than avoid problems, notably a considerable loss of power and residual confounding. In addition, the use of a data-derived ‘optimal’ cutpoint leads to serious bias. We illustrate the impact of dichotomization of continuous predictor variables using as a detailed case study a randomized trial in primary biliary cirrhosis. Dichotomization of continuous data is unnecessary for statistical analysis and in particular should not be applied to explanatory variables in regression models.

	issn = {0022-5347},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: We provide a systematic assessment of the quality and accuracy of statistical reporting in the urology literature.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All original research publications with adult human subjects in a single issue (August 2004) of 4 leading urology journals were identified for formal review. A standardized evaluation form was developed in consultation with an experienced biostatistician and subsequently tested. Two independent reviewers with at least 1 year of formal training in research design and biostatistics who were blinded to authors and institutions reviewed each article. Discrepancies were settled by consensus and/or adjudication by the biostatistician.
RESULTS: Of the 169 articles screened 97 met eligibility criteria for review. Cohort (43 of 97 or 44\%) or cross-sectional (28 of 97 or 29\%) designs comprised the majority of these studies. Only 10 randomized clinical trials (12.4\%) were identified. Statistical tests were identified in 83 studies (93\%). Overall 69 of 83 studies (71\%) providing statistical comparisons had at least 1 statistical error, including using the wrong test for the data type in 28\%, inappropriate use of a parametric test in 22\% and failure to account for multiple comparisons in 65\%. In studies applying multivariate analysis (29\%) over fitting the model with too many variables was the most common statistical flaw (39\%).
CONCLUSIONS: This formal review suggests that statistical methods are often used inappropriately in the urology literature, thereby, potentially undermining the validity of study results and conclusions. An effort to raise the awareness of appropriate statistical techniques through postgraduate education appears indicated.},

Design Structured review of abstracts presenting ratio measures.
Setting Articles published between 1 June 2003 and 1 May 2004 in Annals of Internal Medicine, BMJ, Journal of the American Medical Association, Journal of the National Cancer Institute, Lancet, and New England Journal of Medicine.
Participants 222 articles based on study designs in which absolute risks were directly calculable (61 randomised trials, 161 cohort studies).
Main outcome measure Accessibility of the absolute risks underlying the first ratio measure in the abstract.
Results 68\% of articles (150/222) failed to report the underlying absolute risks for the first ratio measure in the abstract (range 55???81\% across the journals). Among these articles, about half did report the underlying absolute risks elsewhere in the article (text, table, or figure) but half did not report them anywhere. Absolute risks were more likely to be reported in the abstract for randomised trials compared with cohort studies (62\% v 21\%; relative risk 3.0, 95\% confidence interval 2.1 to 4.2) and for studies reporting crude compared with adjusted ratio measures (62\% v 21\%; relative risk 3.0, 2.1 to 4.3).
Conclusion Absolute risks are often not easily accessible in articles reporting ratio measures and sometimes are missing altogether-this lack of accessibility can easily exaggerate readers' perceptions of benefit or harm.},

	issn = {1469-493X},
	doi = {10.1002/14651858.MR000005.pub3},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Abstracts of presentations at scientific meetings are usually available only in conference proceedings. If subsequent full publication of abstract results is based on the magnitude or direction of study results, publication bias may result. Publication bias, in turn, creates problems for those conducting systematic reviews or relying on the published literature for evidence.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the rate at which abstract results are subsequently published in full, and the time between meeting presentation and full publication. To assess the association between study characteristics and full publication.
SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Science Citation Index, reference lists, and author files. Date of most recent search: June 2003.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all reports that examined the subsequent full publication rate of biomedical results initially presented as abstracts or in summary form. Follow-up of abstracts had to be at least two years.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers extracted data. We calculated the weighted mean full publication rate and time to full publication. Dichotomous variables were analyzed using relative risk and random effects models. We assessed time to publication using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses.
MAIN RESULTS: Combining data from 79 reports (29,729 abstracts) resulted in a weighted mean full publication rate of 44.5\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) 43.9 to 45.1). Survival analyses resulted in an estimated publication rate at 9 years of 52.6\% for all studies, 63.1\% for randomized or controlled clinical trials, and 49.3\% for other types of study designs.'Positive' results defined as any 'significant' result showed an association with full publication (RR = 1.30; CI 1.14 to 1.47), as did 'positive' results defined as a result favoring the experimental treatment (RR =1.17; CI 1.02 to 1.35), and 'positive' results emanating from randomized or controlled clinical trials (RR = 1.18, CI 1.07 to 1.30). Other factors associated with full publication include oral presentation (RR = 1.28; CI 1.09 to 1.49); acceptance for meeting presentation (RR = 1.78; CI 1.50 to 2.12); randomized trial study design (RR = 1.24; CI 1.14 to 1.36); and basic research (RR = 0.79; CI 0.70 to 0.89). Higher quality of abstracts describing randomized or controlled clinical trials was also associated with full publication (RR = 1.30, CI 1.00 to 1.71).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Only 63\% of results from abstracts describing randomized or controlled clinical trials are published in full. 'Positive' results were more frequently published than not 'positive' results.},

	abstract = {Some epidemiological studies have shown an association between young maternal age at the time of delivery and risk of cancer in the offspring. In a recent German case-control study, there was a twofold increase in the leukaemia risk for children whose mothers were aged {\textless} 20 years at the time of delivery. As the prevalence of younger mothers among control families was particularly low, data on maternal age distributions for the general population of Germany were obtained in order to examine the representativeness of the control sample. Despite the excellent sampling frame based on data from complete and up-to-date population registries and a satisfactory response rate among controls (71\%), there seemed to be a material deficit of young mothers in the control sample. The prevalence of young mothers in the control group was 1.4\%[95\% CI 0.8\%, 2.0\%] compared with 2.9\% in the general population and 3.3\%[1.8\%, 4.8\%] among leukaemia cases. The most likely cause of this deficit was non-participation. Non-participation bias is hard to identify if no information is available on non-responders and if it results from only small subgroups among the total control sample. Maternal age and childhood leukaemia are an example where differential non-participation creates a spurious moderate association for a relatively rare exposure situation. But nowadays, many epidemiological studies target the detection of small to moderate risk increases for rare exposures. Therefore, the choice of a representative control group as well as the achievement of an excellent response rate are of prime importance.},

	abstract = {Confounding is one of the major types of bias encountered in observational epidemiologic surveys designed to study the relation between an exposure factor and a health event. A common way to remove confounding bias during the statistical analysis phase is to adjust for the confounders in a regression model. If a confounding factor is assessed as a continuous variable, it is necessary to define how the variable is entered into the regression model. In the case of logistic regression, we illustrate through simulation that coding by a binary variable or a categorical variable with broad categories may lead to substantial residual confounding. Specific approaches can be used to define a coding method that limits residual confounding. Among these, we briefly present nonparametric approaches and describe in detail several semiparametric approaches (generalised partial linear models, spline regression and fractional polynomials). These can be used to estimate the relation between a continuous factor and the health event of interest by a smooth non pre-specified function. In semiparametric models, the effect of certain covariates is coded by a parametric function, whereas the coding of one or two continuous variables is represented by a nonparametric function. These models can be used in exploratory analyses to describe dose-effect relations between the confounder and the health event, and thus help to define a relevant coding for the confounder.},

Meta-analyses are increasingly used to address this problem, and they often evaluate observational studies. A workshop was held in Atlanta, Ga, in April 1997, to examine the reporting of meta-analyses of observational studies and to make recommendations to aid authors, reviewers, editors, and readers.ParticipantsTwenty-seven participants were selected by a steering committee, based on expertise in clinical practice, trials, statistics, epidemiology, social sciences, and biomedical editing. Deliberations of the workshop were open to other interested scientists. Funding for this activity was provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.EvidenceWe conducted a systematic review of the published literature on the conduct and reporting of meta-analyses in observational studies using MEDLINE, Educational Research Information Center (ERIC), PsycLIT, and the Current Index to Statistics. We also examined reference lists of the 32 studies retrieved and contacted experts in the field. Participants were assigned to small-group discussions on the subjects of bias, searching and abstracting, heterogeneity, study categorization, and statistical methods.Consensus ProcessFrom the material presented at the workshop, the authors developed a checklist summarizing recommendations for reporting meta-analyses of observational studies. The checklist and supporting evidence were circulated to all conference attendees and additional experts. All suggestions for revisions were addressed.ConclusionsThe proposed checklist contains specifications for reporting of meta-analyses of observational studies in epidemiology, including background, search strategy, methods, results, discussion, and conclusion. Use of the checklist should improve the usefulness of meta-analyses for authors, reviewers, editors, readers, and decision makers. An evaluation plan is suggested and research areas are explored.},

	abstract = {Objectives To explore the accuracy of application of the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) tool in epidemiological studies focused on the evaluation of the role of antibiotics in selecting resistance, and to derive and test an extension of STROBE to improve the suitability of the tool in evaluating the quality of reporting in these area.
Methods A three-step study was performed. First, a systematic review of the literature analysing the association between antimicrobial exposure and acquisition of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and/or multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii was performed. Second, articles were reviewed according to the STROBE checklist for epidemiological studies. Third, a set of potential new items focused on antimicrobial-resistance quality indicators was derived through an expert two-round RAND-modified Delphi procedure and tested on the articles selected through the literature review.
Results The literature search identified 78 studies. Overall, the quality of reporting appeared to be poor in most areas. Five STROBE items, comprising statistical analysis and study objectives, were satisfactory in {\textless}25\% of the studies. Informative abstract, reporting of bias, control of confounding, generalisability and description of study size were missing in more than half the articles. A set of 21 new items was developed and tested. The new items focused particularly on the study setting, antimicrobial usage indicators, and patients epidemiological and clinical characteristics. The performance of the new items in included studies was very low ({\textless}25\%).
Conclusions Our paper reveals that reporting in epidemiological papers analysing the association between antimicrobial usage and development of resistance is poor. The implementation of the newly developed STROBE for antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) tool should enhance appropriate study design and reporting, and therefore contribute to the improvement of evidence to be used for AMS programme development and assessment.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess and compare the quality of nonstructured and structured abstracts of original research articles in three medical journals. DESIGN: Blind, criterion-based observational study. SAMPLE: Random sample of 300 abstracts (25 abstracts per journal each year) of articles published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), the Canadian Medical Association Journal and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in 1988 and 1989 (nonstructured abstracts) and in 1991 and 1992 (structured abstracts). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The quality of abstracts was measured against 33 objective criteria, which were divided into eight categories (purpose, research design, setting, subjects, intervention, measurement of variables, results and conclusions). The quality score was determined by dividing the number of criteria present by the number applicable; the score varied from 0 to 1. RESULTS: The overall mean quality scores for nonstructured and structured abstracts were 0.57 and 0.74 respectively (p {\textless} 0.001). The frequency in meeting the specific criteria was generally higher for the structured abstracts than for the nonstructured ones. The mean quality score was higher for nonstructured abstracts in JAMA than for those in BMJ (0.60 v. 0.54, p {\textless} 0.05). The scores for structured abstracts did not differ significantly between the three journals. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support recommendations that promote the use of structured abstracts. Further studies should be performed to assess the effect of time on the quality of abstracts and the extent to which abstracts reflect the content of the articles.},

Two raters independently assessed 49 randomly selected articles describing stroke research published from 1999 to 2003 in six journals: American Journal of Epidemiology, Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, Stroke, Annals of Neurology, Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, and American Journal of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. On average, 17 of the 33 checklist criteria were reported. Criteria describing the study design were better reported than those related to internal validity. No relation was found between study type (etiologic or prognostic) or word count and quality of reporting. A flow diagram for summarizing participant flow through a study was developed.

Of these definitions, the AR as suggested by Levin in 1953 or some algebraic transformations of it are most commonly used. A structured literature search, based on the Medline database, identified 334 original epidemiological studies dealing with this AR published between 1966 and 1996 (mostly case-control studies). A considerable increase in the number of published studies incorporating some quantification of the exposure impact on the population level in terms of the AR was observed in the last decade. However, in 64.5\% of these studies no exact definition of the AR used was given. Adjustment procedures necessary in multifactorial situations were performed by only 37.5\%, confidence intervals for the AR were given by only 19.3\% of authors. Thus, although the increasing popularity of this important epidemiological measure is encouraging, its correct application and comprehensive reporting in medical practice should be promoted further.},

Developers of such models often rely on an Events Per Variable criterion (EPV), notably EPV ???10, to determine the minimal sample size required and the maximum number of candidate predictors that can be examined. We present an extensive simulation study in which we studied the influence of EPV, events fraction, number of candidate predictors, the correlations and distributions of candidate predictor variables, area under the ROC curve, and predictor effects on out-of-sample predictive performance of prediction models. The out-of-sample performance (calibration, discrimination and probability prediction error) of developed prediction models was studied before and after regression shrinkage and variable selection. The results indicate that EPV does not have a strong relation with metrics of predictive performance, and is not an appropriate criterion for (binary) prediction model development studies. We show that out-of-sample predictive performance can better be approximated by considering the number of predictors, the total sample size and the events fraction. We propose that the development of new sample size criteria for prediction models should be based on these three parameters, and provide suggestions for improving sample size determination.},

If the effect of measurement error is misjudged, the data analyses are hampered and the validity of the study inferences may be affected. In this paper, we describe five myths that contribute to misjudgments about measurement error, regarding expected structure, impact and solutions to mitigate the problems resulting from mismeasurements. The aim is to clarify these measurement error misconceptions. We show that the influence of measurement error in an epidemiological data analysis can play out in ways that go beyond simple heuristics, such as heuristics about whether or not to expect attenuation of the effect estimates. Whereas we encourage epidemiologists to deliberate about the structure and potential impact of measurement error in their analyses, we also recommend exercising restraint when making claims about the magnitude or even direction of effect of measurement error if not accompanied by statistical measurement error corrections or quantitative bias analysis. Suggestions for alleviating the problems or investigating the structure and magnitude of measurement error are given.},

Recent theoretical and methodological developments have helped clarify a number of principles of confounder selection. When complete knowledge of a causal diagram relating all covariates to each other is available, graphical rules can be used to make decisions about covariate control. Unfortunately, such complete knowledge is often unavailable. This paper puts forward a practical approach to confounder selection decisions when the somewhat less stringent assumption is made that knowledge is available for each covariate whether it is a cause of the exposure, and whether it is a cause of the outcome. Based on recent theoretically justified developments in the causal inference literature, the following proposal is made for covariate control decisions: control for each covariate that is a cause of the exposure, or of the outcome, or of both; exclude from this set any variable known to be an instrumental variable; and include as a covariate any proxy for an unmeasured variable that is a common cause of both the exposure and the outcome. Various principles of confounder selection are then further related to statistical covariate selection methods.},

Design 1970 British birth cohort.
Participants 16 567 babies born in Great Britain 5-11 April 1970 and followed up at 5, 10, and 29-30 years.
Main outcome measures Obesity at age 10 and 30 years. Self reported socioeconomic, educational, psychological, and social outcomes at 30 years. Odds ratios were calculated for the risk of each adult outcome associated with obesity in childhood only, obesity in adulthood only, and persistent child and adult obesity, compared with those obese at neither period.
Results Of the 8490 participants with data on body mass index at 10 and 30 years, 4.3\% were obese at 10 years and 16.3\% at 30 years. Obesity in childhood only was not associated with adult social class, income, years of schooling, educational attainment, relationships, or psychological morbidity in either sex after adjustment for confounding factors. Persistent obesity was not associated with any adverse adult outcomes in men, though it was associated among women with a higher risk of never having been gainfully employed (odds ratio 1.9, 95\% confidence interval 1.1 to 3.3) and not having a current partner (2.0, 1.3 to 3.3).
Conclusions Obesity limited to childhood has little impact on adult outcomes. Persistent obesity in women is associated with poorer employment and relationship outcomes. Efforts to reduce the socioeconomic and psychosocial burden of obesity in adult life should focus on prevention of the persistence of obesity from childhood into adulthood.},

Design: Cross sectional survey with merged records of extent of restrictions on smoking in public places.
Setting: United States.
Participants: 17 287 high school students.
Main outcome measures: Five point scale of smoking uptake; 30 day smoking prevalence.
Results: More restrictive arrangements on smoking at home were associated with a greater likelihood of being in an earlier stage of smoking uptake (P{\textless}0.05) and a lower 30 day prevalence (odds ratio 0.79 (95\% confidence interval 0.67 to 0.91), P{\textless}0.001). These findings applied even when parents were smokers. More pervasive restrictions on smoking in public places were associated with a higher probability of being in a earlier stage of smoking uptake (P{\textless}0.05) and lower 30 day prevalence (0.91 (0.83 to 0.99), P=0.03). School smoking bans were related to a greater likelihood of being in an earlier stage of smoking uptake (0.89 (0.85 to 0.99), P{\textless}0.05) and lower prevalence (0.86 (0.77 to 0.94), P{\textless}0.001) only when the ban was strongly enforced, as measured by instances when teenagers perceived that most or all students obeyed the rule.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that restrictions on smoking at home, more extensive bans on smoking in public places, and enforced bans on smoking at school may reduce teenage smoking.},

Professor Gerry Shaper and colleagues submitted a 5-year proposal to the Medical Research Council: to examine the factors responsible for the considerable regional variation in coronary heart disease, hypertension, and stroke in Great Britain, and to determine the causes of these conditions in order to provide a rational basis for recommendations towards their prevention. This proposal embraced the water hardness hypothesis but extended the potential of the data collected to produce a more substantial and wider ranging enquiry into the causes of CHD both at the individual and the regional level: The British},

Many national public health systems and international organizations rely on RDS data. However, RDS reporting quality and available reporting guidelines are inadequate. We carried out a systematic review of RDS studies and present Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology for RDS Studies (STROBE-RDS), a checklist of essential items to present in RDS publications, justified by an explanation and elaboration document.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We searched the MEDLINE (1970-2013), EMBASE (1974-2013), and Global Health (1910-2013) databases to assess the number and geographical distribution of published RDS studies. STROBE-RDS was developed based on STROBE guidelines, following Guidance for Developers of Health Research Reporting Guidelines.
RESULTS: RDS has been used in over 460 studies from 69 countries, including the USA (151 studies), China (70), and India (32). STROBE-RDS includes modifications to 12 of the 22 items on the STROBE checklist. The two key areas that required modification concerned the selection of participants and statistical analysis of the sample.
CONCLUSION: STROBE-RDS seeks to enhance the transparency and utility of research using RDS. If widely adopted, STROBE-RDS should improve global infectious diseases public health decision making.},

	abstract = {Objective
To explore development of possible approaches leading to a sensitive and precise Medline search to identify observational studies of the association between oral contraceptives and breast cancer, an adverse event.
Study Design and Setting
We compared the results of a series of Medline searches to a gold standard comprising 58 reports from a 1996 systematic review examining the relationship between oral contraceptives and the development of breast cancer. Sensitivity (the proportion of gold standard publications identified) and precision (the proportion of retrieved publications that were included in the gold standard) were calculated for each Medline search.
Results
We identified all 58 articles when the search was not limited by terms related to oral contraceptives, but precision was less than 1\% (58 of 6,120). Indexing was problematic when oral contraceptives or hormones were not mentioned in the title or abstract (n=8) or full text (n=2).
Conclusion
Search strategies identifying all relevant studies were possible but arguably impractical; additional research is needed to generalize our findings. Authors and editors should ensure that all interventions and outcomes examined are reported and indexers should make sure they are indexed. Central registration of observational studies and all variables they examined should be considered to assure identification of studies examining adverse events associated with health interventions.},

However, because ethnic minority women are disproportionately poor, socioeconomic status (SES) may substantially explain these risk factor differences.Objective.-To determine whether differences in CVD risk factors by ethnicity could be attributed to differences in SES.Design.-Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted between 1988 and 1994.Setting.-Eighty-nine mobile examination centers.Participants.-A total of 1762 black, 1481 Mexican American, and 2023 white women, aged 25 to 64 years, who completed both the home questionnaire and medical examination.Main Outcome Measures.-Ethnicity and years of education (SES) in relation to systolic blood pressure, cigarette smoking, body mass index (BMI, a measure of weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters), physical inactivity, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C [the difference between total cholesterol and HDL-C]), and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.Results.-As expected, most CVD risk factors were higher among ethnic minority women than among white women. After adjusting for years of education, highly significant differences in blood pressure, BMI, physical inactivity, and diabetes remained for both black and Mexican American women compared with white women (P\&lt;.001). In addition, women of lower SES from each of the 3 ethnic groups had significantly higher prevalences of smoking and physical inactivity and higher levels of BMI and non-HDL-C than women of higher SES (P\&lt;.001).Conclusions.-These findings provide the greatest evidence to date of higher CVD risk factors among black and Mexican American women than among white women of comparable SES. The striking differences by both ethnicity and SES underscore the critical need to improve screening, early detection, and treatment of CVD-related conditions for black and Mexican American women, as well as for women of lower SES in all ethnic groups.},

The study subjects consisted of 171 cases and 308 controls matched by age, sex, and place of residence. The analysis was performed by conditional logistic regression. Risk factors found to be significantly associated with ACL were related to indoor transmission (few rooms in the house, dirt floor, and a permanent opening in lieu of a window); peridomestic transmission (presence of a pond or woodland within 150 m of the house and an agricultural area within 200 m of the house); and human behavior (sleeping in the backyard, collecting water, bathing, and performing agricultural activities). Most transmission appears to have occurred indoors and in the peridomicile. These environments should be included in further research and control policies.},
