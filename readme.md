This repository contains all files for an Educational Expansion to the STROBE Statement. 

 Drawing inspiration from the [#epitwitter community](https://twitter.com/hashtag/epitwitter?lang=en), the [Open Science Massive Online Course](https://opensciencemooc.eu/), and [Data Methods](https://discourse.datamethods.org/), we hope that this will become a living site which can be used and modified by the epidemiology community and those interested in sharing epidemiological knowledge in accessible ways.
