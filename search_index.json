Epidemiology, the study of diseases and population health, is a broad field with ever-changing methods and often heated debates about proper designs, analyses, and approaches. Therefore, we think it is important that there is a place where epidemiologists can share their knowledge in an open and transparent manner. Drawing inspiration from the #epitwitter community, the Open Science Massive Online Course, and Data Methods, we hope that this will become a living site which can be used and modified by the epidemiology community and those interested in sharing epidemiological knowledge in accessible ways. For a quick peek into how this site works and how you can contribute, please check out the Frequently Asked Questions page. This site is uses the R Bookdown package, which is built using R Markdown. All content is stored in the GitHub repository of Melissa Sharp, a doctoral student who worked on observational research methods. Please contact her if you have any comments, questions, or concerns. Structure We aim to be as inclusive as possible but are structuring this site on the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline. STROBE was created in 2007 and is comprised of a 22-item checklist of essential items to report when discussing the results from a cohort, cross-sectional, or case-control study (Elm et al., 2007; Vandenbroucke et al., 2007). It has been endorsed by the International Commitee of Medcial Journal Editors and hundreds of journals and has spawned at least another 13 field- or method-specific extensions. (Benchimol et al., 2015; Cheng et al., 2016; Creinin &amp; Chen, 2016 ; Field et al., 2014; Gallo et al., 2012; Horby et al., 2017; Hornell et al., 2017; Lachat et al., 2016; Little et al., 2009; O’Connor et al., 2016; Tacconelli et al., 2016; White et al., 2015; Zavada et al., 2014) Figure 1: STROBE Checklist STROBE and this book follows the IMRaD (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) style of reporting research. The content from STROBE’s Explanation and Elaboration document (Vandenbroucke et al., 2007) will be included in this site as it explains why each item on the STROBE checklist is important and it gives examples of “good reporting”. Additional information will be supplied from the dissertation of Melissa Sharp and the projects contained within it – particularly results from a qualitative assessment of the content in the STROBE Extensions. (Sharp et al., 2018) Hopefully, over time, others will contribute additional examples and resources related to each STROBE item. Content is designed in a modular format that is aligned with the design of the STROBE Checklist. - If you are familiar with epidemiological research methods and STROBE, you can pick and choose what items to explore. - Otherwise, if you are unexperienced, you can follow the structure in a more linear fashion, beginning with an introduction on the concept of reporting guidelines and their use. Audience The content in this book will appeal to those who work in observational research, need a refresher on certain epidemiological topics, or want to improve their scientific writing skills. Some baseline understanding of clinical or public health research may be helpful though since using STROBE should imply that you have or are working in health research. Content We hope to help you develop your understanding of study designs, data collection, statistical analysis, and interpretation of results. This site will not cover key aspects of the conduct of research, such as the skills needed for personal interactions with patients and participants, detailed analytical skills, regulatory frameworks, nor science communication skills needed to disseminate your work to the general public. All are important areas influencing items covered in this course but the breadth is too great to go over each area in depth. Rather, we aim to provide supplementary information along the way that will help you explore and grow in these areas if you so wish.

["observational-studies.html", "Observational Studies Why STROBE? What is STROBE?", " Observational Studies Careful design and analysis of observational studies is essential because they are not structured to control for these external factors, thus they are especially prone to bias and confounding (Dreyer et al., 2010; Hemkens et al., 2018; Song &amp; Chung, 2010). In an ideal world, people would be able to use randomized control trials more often, however, sometimes it is simply unethical or impractical to conduct an RCT (Scales et al., 2005; Song &amp; Chung, 2010). For example, when investigating socioeconomic impacts on health or surgical procedures. Due to the complex design and conduct of observational studies, they have been deemed to be “the most necessary and difficult” studies to conduct (Harper, 2019). Observational studies are conducted in real-world settings and can investigate the impact of health policies on populations and explore the distribution of health outcomes across groups (Dreyer et al., 2010). RCTs simply cannot achieve these same results. Observational research also allows participants to be followed for longer periods of time meaning that one can evaluate changes in health outcomes throughout the lifespan. Furthermore, observational studies affordably provide a larger number of participants in comparison to RCTs (Dreyer et al., 2010). This allows investigations into differences between subgroups in the population (e.g., different age groups, disease subtypes) (Ligthelm et al., 2007). Given the breadth of topics that observational studies can cover, it is no surprise that it is the most common study design used in biomedical research (Funai et al., 2001). Why STROBE? Due to a high prevalence of observational studies in biomedical research, widespread poor reporting means that an enormous amount of the medical literature has issues. Research has shown that items concerning the methodology and results of observational studies are particularly poorly reported reported (Irani et al., 2018; Jeelani et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2012; Langan et al., 2010; Papathanasiou &amp; Zintzaras, 2010; Poorolajal J et al., 2011). Details about participants, data collection methods, and analyses are common problems. Missing details on how many people were eligible to participate, consented, and lost to follow-up questions the generalizability of results. Whereas, missing data, the reliability of the data collection instruments used, how the data was analyzed, and missing disclosures of funding sources can be worrying as motives for certain narratives or results may be hidden. Therefore, a reporting guideline for observational research is critically needed to reinforce replicability and reproducibility and instill greater confidence in the trustworthiness of results. What is STROBE? The STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Statement is a 22-item checklist that details the key information needed when reporting the results of an observational study (Elm et al., 2007) (Figure 1). It is also accompanied by an Explanation and Elaboration (E&amp;E) document that provides further details for each checklist item and gives examples of good reporting (Vandenbroucke et al., 2007). STROBE comes as a downloadable checklist. You can download a fillable Word checklist (or static pdf) on the STROBE website. There is also a Writing Aid Tool for Microsoft that you can download and install which includes the STROBE checklist within the software. For detailed background and guidance on STROBE you can read the Explanation and Elaboration (Vandenbroucke et al., 2007) article. Briefly put, STROBE does not dictate how to conduct research nor the specific order that items should be written in (only that they should be under the relevant IMRaD heading). Some items may not be applicable to your study, just state so and explain why. STROBE is not meant to be a “procedural straightjacket”, rather, think of it as a life jacket. Its structure may be helpful for study planing or peer review but it is not designed for that purpose. References "],
["intro-title-and-abstract-1.html", "Intro: Title and abstract (1) Explanation 1a Examples 1a Explanation 1b Example 1b Field-specific guidance Resources", " Intro: Title and abstract (1) The items from STROBE state that you should report: - Indicate the study’s design with a commonly used term in the title or the abstract; AND - Provide in the abstract, an informative and balanced summary of what was done and what was found (Vandenbroucke et al., 2007) First and foremost, thoughtful consideration must be given to the title of your work and the abstract. Based on which journal you plan on submitting your work to, they might provide restrictions on how many words you can use, so be as concise and unambiguous as possible. Try to be as objective as possible and frame your findings correctly. Although this is the first item in the checklist, some people find that it is the easiest to write these at or near the end of your work as it contains the key messages that you want to focus on. Some key items to consider adding: - The study design (e.g., cohort, cross-sectional, case-control). - Information about the data source (e.g., bibliometric, patient registry, etc.) - Information about the timing of data collection (e.g., longitudinal, date ranges) - The main results (e.g., “found high rates of x”, \" ) Explanation 1a Readers should be able to easily identify the design that was used from the title or abstract. An explicit, commonly used term for the study design also helps ensure correct indexing of articles in electronic databases.(Benson &amp; Hartz, 2000; Vandenbroucke et al., 2007) Examples 1a “Leukemia incidence among workers in the shoe and boot manufacturing industry: a case-control study” (Forand, 2004; Vandenbroucke et al., 2007) “The consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages was derived from 7 repeated FFQs administered between 1980 and 2002” (Fung et al., 2009; Hornell et al., 2017; Vandenbroucke et al., 2007) “Key finding/exposures” among/in “sample/population” during “time period of study/data collection” : “study design” “Study design” investigating “exposures” among “sample/population” during “time period of study/data collection” found “key findings” Explanation 1b The abstract provides key information that enables readers to understand a study and decide whether to read the article. Typical components include a statement of the research question, a short description of methods and results, and a conclusion (American Journal of Epidemiology, 2007). Abstracts should summarize key details of studies and should only present information that is provided in the article. We advise presenting key results in a numerical form that includes numbers of participants, estimates of associations and appropriate measures of variability and uncertainty (e.g., odds ratios with confidence intervals). We regard it insufficient to state only that an exposure is or is not significantly associated with an outcome. A series of headings pertaining to the background, design, conduct, and analysis of a study may help readers acquire the essential information rapidly (Haynes, 1990). Many journals require such structured abstracts, which tend to be of higher quality and more readily informative than unstructured summaries (Hartley &amp; Sydes, 1996; Taddio et al., 1994; Vandenbroucke et al., 2007). Example 1b Background: The expected survival of HIV-infected patients is of major public health interest. Objective: To estimate survival time and age-specific mortality rates of an HIV-infected population compared with that of the general population. Design: Population-based cohort study. Setting: All HIV-infected persons receiving care in Denmark from 1995 to 2005. Patients: Each member of the nationwide Danish HIV Cohort Study was matched with as many as 99 persons from the general population according to sex, date of birth, and municipality of residence. Measurements: The authors computed Kaplan–Meier life tables with age as the time scale to estimate survival from age 25 years. Patients with HIV infection and corresponding persons from the general population were observed from the date of the patient’s HIV diagnosis until death, emigration, or 1 May 2005. Results: 3990 HIV-infected patients and 379 872 persons from the general population were included in the study, yielding 22 744 (median, 5.8 y/person) and 2 689 287 (median, 8.4 years/person) person-years of observation. Three percent of participants were lost to follow-up. From age 25 years, the median survival was 19.9 years (95% CI, 18.5 to 21.3) among patients with HIV infection and 51.1 years (CI, 50.9 to 51.5) among the general population. For HIV-infected patients, survival increased to 32.5 years (CI, 29.4 to 34.7) during the 2000 to 2005 period. In the subgroup that excluded persons with known hepatitis C coinfection (16%), median survival was 38.9 years (CI, 35.4 to 40.1) during this same period. The relative mortality rates for patients with HIV infection compared with those for the general population decreased with increasing age, whereas the excess mortality rate increased with increasing age. Limitations: The observed mortality rates are assumed to apply beyond the current maximum observation time of 10 years. Conclusions: The estimated median survival is more than 35 years for a young person diagnosed with HIV infection in the late highly active antiretroviral therapy era. However, an ongoing effort is still needed to further reduce mortality rates for these persons compared with the general population (Lohse et al., 2007; Vandenbroucke et al., 2007) Field-specific guidance Infectious disease molecular epidemiology (Field et al., 2014) - The term molecular epidemiology should be applied to the study in the title or abstract and the keywords when molecular and epidemiological methods contribute substantially to the study Molecular epidemiology (Gallo et al., 2012) - State the use of speciﬁc biomarker(s) in the title and ⁄or in the abstract if they contribute substantially to the ﬁndings Nutritional data (Lachat et al., 2016) - State the dietary/nutritional assessment method(s) used in the title, abstract, or keywords Response-driven sampling (White et al., 2015) - Indicate “respondent-driven sampling” in the title or abstract Routinely collected health data (Benchimol et al., 2015) - The type of data used should be speciﬁed in the title or abstract. When possible, the name of the databases used should be included - If applicable, the geographic region and time frame within which the study took place should be reported in the title or abstract - If linkage between databases was conducted for the study, this should be clearly stated in the title or abstract Seroepidemiologic studies for influenza (Horby et al., 2017) - The term “seroepidemiologic,” “seroepidemiology,” “seroprevalence,” or “seroincidence” should be applied to the study in the title or abstract, and the medical subject heading “Seroepidemiologic Studies” be used when the report is of a population-based serological survey Simulation-based research (Cheng et al., 2016) - In abstract or key terms, the MESH or searchable keyword term must have the word simulation or simulated Resources Do you know of any good guidance or resources related to this item?
